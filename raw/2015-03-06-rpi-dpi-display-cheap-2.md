Recently the internet noticed the Raspberry Pi could drive LCD panels using DPI. This allows very inexpensive displays to be used with basically no additional hardware.

This is not a full post, just capturing some details from someone elses blog post so I don't lose it (will my site become my next bookmark holder?).

Summary:

<ul>
<li>Robert Ely learned his tricks from this <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=100&amp;t=86658">forum post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1932">40-pin TFT Friend</a> $9.95</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1680">5.0″ 40-pin 800×480 TFT Display without Touchscreen</a>  $29.95</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/266">Premium Female/Female Jumper Wires – 40 x 6″</a> $3.95</li>
</ul>

Total: $43.85

That being said, I see a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2300">Pi: 7" Display no Touchscreen 1024x600 w/ Mini Driver</a> for $70 with no messing with HDMI.

I also recently purchased a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-lcd-Controller-board-VS-TY50-V2-5inch-HSD050IDW1-Lcd-Remote-control-/360938515563?ssPageName=ADME:X:AAQ:US:1123">5"  800x480 screen with an hdmi driver off of a chinese vendor on ebay</a> for $42.75. It just takes a month or so to arrive.
