<p>Finally connected my DVR to the network. It's an LaView lv-d0404bs (4-ch dvr). I searched all over and couldn't find an rtsp url for this model. Finally, I did what I should have done, and opened the source of the web page.</p>
<p>I found this bit of code:     <code>var url = "rtsp://" + ip + ":" + port + "/H264?ch="+channelnum+"&amp;subtype=" + _type;</code></p>
<p>Which translates to:</p>
<p><code>rtsp://[IP]:554//H264?ch=[CAMERA]&amp;subtype=1</code></p>
<p>I am not sure what the difference in sub-types is. Valid values are 0 &amp; 1, and they seem to have the same resolution. Sub-type 0 seems to scale to fill the window, whereas 1 starts off at a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p>
