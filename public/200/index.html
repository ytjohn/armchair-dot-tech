  <p>so I got up this morning around 8:30 and thought of all those poor people I
know that have been up for over 4 hours already and have been hard at work since
the sun came up.  I could be one of those people, but curiously enough, I am
not.  I think that&rsquo;s because in the beginning of this month, I parted ways with
the Marine Corp.  A slow sense of relief begins to roll over me.</p>

<p>To atone for not doing Marine things this weekend, I decided to go down to
the hospital and get a drug screening.  Of course, unlike doing this for the
Marine Corp, I can hope to get more money by doing this one.  I&rsquo;m essentially
on the 4th step of becoming a Dell Warranty Service Provider.  I already have
passed two tests to become a Dell Certified Systems Expert, passed their
background check, and now I&rsquo;m simply waiting for them to test my pee.  I should
be clean, I haven&rsquo;t taken so much as an asprin since mid-January, and that time
was against my better judgement.  Before that, it&rsquo;s been two years.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://ru-wired.com/">buddy</a> of mine has been working with a
group of people to setup <a href="http://www.raystown-wireless.com/">wireless
internet</a> for <a href="http://www.raystownlake.com/">Raystown Lake</a>.
The system runs on 900Mhz and the <a href="http://www.waverider.com/">home
units</a> can hit a tower up to 25 miles away.  The towers sit on the mountains
ringing the lake and broadcast into areas that don&rsquo;t have cable or dsl available
(and aren&rsquo;t likely for quite a while, unless
<a href="http://www.wimax.com/education">wiMax</a> comes into play).  This is
a much better setup than some <a href="http://www.mttfirst.com/">others</a>
that broadcast at 2.4ghz and cover less than a mile per tower.  This company
(despite their claims) only covers areas that already have cheaper/more reliable
cable and dsl internet.  Anyways, I only mention this because I get to do the
installs at the customer&rsquo;s houses, get paid, and pass out business cards to
people that are just now getting connected to the broadband world.</p>

<p>In other news, things have gone wonderfully well between Robin and me, and
she has met just about all of my friends (though some of them seem to be
unavailable quite a bit) and most of my family.  After all that and she still
wants to hang around?  I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
