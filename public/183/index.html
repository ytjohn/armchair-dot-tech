  <p>Hmm&hellip; what&rsquo;s new?  Well obviously it&rsquo;s (for many people) Christmas day, unless your Orthodox Christian, in which case that&rsquo;s (I might be wrong on this) January 6th.  Anyways, per tradition, my family is having their celebration on Monday.  I&rsquo;ll be spending today drifting from family to family, spending time with friends.</p>

<p>Going back a bit in time, traveling up to the present&hellip;  I met a nice young lady online about a week ago (this is becoming a theme now, isn&rsquo;t it?) that is actually local.  I mean&hellip; wow.  But it doesn&rsquo;t end there.  From initial conversations, she not only says she is Christian, but seems to be so.  Furthermore, she&rsquo;s single, in college (going for a nursing degree), and seems rather intelligent, has the many of the same ideas as I do concerning non-dating/going out (and while this shouldn&rsquo;t really be mentioned like it&rsquo;s a priority, she&rsquo;s also pleasing to the eye).</p>

<p>So Robin (yes, that&rsquo;s her name, try to keep up will you?) invited me out to their 11pm service on Saturday (which is yesterday for those of you reading this without a calendar), and that went pretty well.  It was a Lutheran candlelight service, which is rife with tradition, but contrary to popular belief, I&rsquo;m not actually against tradition, and I was pleased with the service, as well as the meeting with Robin.  We didn&rsquo;t get much time to talk, but after I got home, she caught me online before going to bed and invited me over for xmas dinner, which I gladly accepted.</p>

<p>So&hellip; all in all, a good week.  I won&rsquo;t really get into the Toys For Tots thing our unit did last weekend, other than to say it was a decently good weekend, I was exhausted at the end of it, and that&rsquo;s about all I&rsquo;m going into.  Hmmm&hellip; this site is tourning more into a journal than a rant site, isn&rsquo;t it?  I&rsquo;ll have to change that back.  Also, I will be sticking with the Marines for another month or two on &ldquo;non-obligated&rdquo; status, which means I can quit/walk out at any time.  I am definately not going with them on AT come June, so I will be quitting before that comes.</p>

<p>Ok, and with that, I am off to bed.</p>
