  <p>Several interesting things (to me at least) have occurred recently.Ã‚Â  For the most part I&rsquo;ve been spending my time doing wireless installs and network troubleshooting for Skyweb down in Berkeley Springs.
Robin and her family has had a few rough spots recently.Ã‚Â  Her Uncle Lonnie died on the 20th, we had the viewing on the 22nd and the funeral the next day.Ã‚Â   The day after, she nailed a deer with her car, and then the day after that, her sister&rsquo;s fiance&rsquo;s great grandfather died.
On more positive note, my friends Matt &amp; Nicole came down on the 23rd and hosted a game night at their parent&rsquo;s house.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  We had a good time, up until Trivial Pursuit. I am not a fan of that game, and neither was a few other people.Ã‚Â  But otherwise, good times, good times.
Christmas Eve marked 1 full year with Robin, and we went to her church&rsquo;s Christmas Eve service.Ã‚Â  Christmas day was another matter altogether.Ã‚Â  We opened a couple presents in the morning at Robin&rsquo;s, then she left for work and I was off &ldquo;on my rounds&rdquo;.
My first stop was at Greg &amp; Tricia&rsquo;s house.Ã‚Â  I apparently had arrived before it was time for anyone to arrive, but was able to entertain myself with a Rubik cube for several hours.Ã‚Â  I never solved it of course &ndash; except through the technique of moving the stickers around, I am pretty sure it&rsquo;s impossible (anyone that claims otherwise is lying).Ã‚Â  The next stop was at the Clarke&rsquo;s.Ã‚Â  They had finished up their gift exchange and meal time by then, but once again, I was faced with a daunting puzzle.Ã‚Â  This time, it was a wood puzzle that you take apart and put back together.Ã‚Â  I was able to get it apart, but in two hours I had made little progress in getting it back together.Ã‚Â  I did get some interesting shapes made, but nothing quite matching the original.Ã‚Â  A very puzzling day so far.Ã‚Â  The third and final stop of the day was back at Robin&rsquo;s for the Christmas dinner.
Thursday was the next Christmas party in a series.Ã‚Â  This one was my family&rsquo;s Christmas, up at Lisa&rsquo;s in E-town.Ã‚Â  Robin went with me (of course) and we rode up with Mom &amp; Dad, spending the night.Ã‚Â  Somehow, Robin wasn&rsquo;t scared away by the entire family showing up &ndash; but they said they would try harder next time.
Finally, as if 4 Christmas&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t enough, on Saturday we went to the Carson&rsquo;s Family Christmas up in Freedom, PA.Ã‚Â  I was supposed to meet a lot of the Robin&rsquo;s family on her Mom&rsquo;s side, but no one else felt like showing up, so it was a pretty small gathering.</p>
