  <p>This was quite a weekend.  Thursday started off like any other day.. get up, go to work, leave work.  The change came when I got close to home and I decided on a whim to try and call up an old friend of mine (by old, I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that she is older than me) and actually got ahold of her.  We talked and caught up on news till I stopped in the local BPs for some Chester Fried Chicken&hellip; the bomb* (*not affiliated with BPs or Chester Fried), where we talked some more before I could even order my chicken, and I got invited out to a biscuit and pepsi party, which got me mightily excited, as you can imagine.  So of course, I go.  Now, I should point out that my friend&rsquo;s name is Alice, her sister (who is also a friend) is Sarah, and Sarah is dating a guy that shares my first name, so Alice occasionally uses that coincidence to play mischevious pranks upon Sarah. <br />
In any event, I arrive at the B&amp;P party and we begin the movie watching event.  By and by, in walks&hellip; Sarah&rsquo;s boyfriend, and we are introduced (this being the first time we have met).  We eye each other up for a minute, and simultaneously he says &ldquo;Hoagie!&rdquo; as I exclaim &ldquo;Griffith!&rdquo; and we slap each other on the back.  Alice and Sarah are wide-eyed with disbelief and disillusion.  At this point, I should explain that I occasionally go by the nickname &ldquo;Hoagie&rdquo;, and this &ldquo;Griffith&rdquo; character is actually my twin brother, born in different cities, and&hellip; to different parents.  I haven&rsquo;t seen him in 4 years&hellip; until now.  </p></p>

<p>As you can imagine, there was much rejoicing&hellip; much quoting of Monty Python and  Emporor&rsquo;s New Groove (&ldquo;Now what are the odds of that happening?&rdquo; &ldquo;And there was much rejoicing&hellip; Yay! <em>waves flag</em>&rdquo;), and much B&amp;P consumption till we eventually decided around 3am to head our seperate ways.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t do much on Friday due to the imminent return of &ldquo;the parents&rdquo;, but on Saturday we went to watch The Passion, which is quite a good movie.  This was my first viewing of The Passion, (the first for all of us), so that was worthwhile.  Again, the group (we&rsquo;re forming a sort of scooby gang) remained together till about 2am before going our respective ways.  Sunday was my day of rest, and now this morning I awoke at 6am, much to my dismay.  Otherwise, a blissful weekend with relaxation being the key.</p>
