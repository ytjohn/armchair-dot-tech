That\u0026rsquo;s spouse, children, parents, in-laws. I thought I was going to put play around with some GMRS repeater/text data modes, never did.\nFlash forward to more recent. Picked up a 4-pack of Baofeng BF-888S radios. These go for about $13 apiece and $42 for a 4-pack. They\u0026rsquo;re 2-watt radios, and channelized (16 channels). Program with a computer, dead simple for others. Gave one to my wife\u0026rsquo;s sister who lives 2 miles down the road. She can talk crystal clear to my son from inside her house. I drove around town with one able to talk to my son as well.\n Adding a frequency list to the back is good if you want to talk to someone else.\nFRS is limited to specific radios and 1\u0026frasl;2 watt. These BF-888S radios are NOT FRS compliant. T GMRS allows 5W on FRS shared frequencies and 50 watts on dedicated. Amateur radio requires a control operator to be physically near the radio. With today\u0026rsquo;s cheap radios, you can get high powered FRS radios, or use MURS frequencies, or find some off the books frequencies; There are lots of space between the FRS channels, and there are some old airplane to ground cellular frequencies that have been phased out. No one is monitoring and even at 5W, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to bother anyone enough to draw enforcement. However, GMRS is probably the cheapest and easiest way to get long range legal communications going for a family (or small business). In my case if you consider 4 people will be using it, it comes to $4/user/year. We could even put a repeater on the roof, or some higher powered vehicle antennas if desired. We probably won\u0026rsquo;t, because the whole goal is to replace my son\u0026rsquo;s (now dead) walkie talkies with something that really works. The fact that he can talk to his Aunt down the road is a big bonus.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/gmrs-for-fun/","tags":["gmrs","radio"],"title":"GMRS is pretty cheap and easy"},{"categories":null,"contents":" ansible flush handlers In ansible playbooks, handlers (such as to restart a service) normally happen at the end of a run.

Since the app itself relies entirely on external data, I was wondering how in the world I would write unit tests for it. It\u0026rsquo;s written in python using the amazing apistar framework. All of my external data so far is gathered using the requests library. The answer for this, turns out to requests-mock. Requests-mock will allow you create mock responses to requests.\nThe documentation is pretty straightforward, but I was having some trouble wrapping my head around how I would use it to test the code in my app. To start simple, I decided to mock consul, which is one of my datasources.\nGet a value into consul First off, let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and setup. Go to https://www.consul.io/ and download the consul binary for your OS.\n Start consul in dev mode/foreground: consul agent -dev Insert a key: consul kv put foo bar Let\u0026rsquo;s request that key with curl. Be verbose, because there are some headers you\u0026rsquo;ll want later.  $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/foo -v * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8500 (#0) \u0026amp;gt; GET /v1/kv/foo HTTP/1.1 \u0026amp;gt; Host: localhost:8500 \u0026amp;gt; User-Agent: curl/7.54.0 \u0026amp;gt; Accept: */* \u0026amp;gt; \u0026amp;lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK \u0026amp;lt; Content-Type: application/json \u0026amp;lt; X-Consul-Index: 7 \u0026amp;lt; X-Consul-Knownleader: true \u0026amp;lt; X-Consul-Lastcontact: 0 \u0026amp;lt; Date: Thu, 04 Jan 2018 11:04:20 GMT \u0026amp;lt; Content-Length: 158 \u0026amp;lt; [ { \u0026amp;quot;LockIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 0, \u0026amp;quot;Key\u0026amp;quot;: \u0026amp;quot;foo\u0026amp;quot;, \u0026amp;quot;Flags\u0026amp;quot;: 0, \u0026amp;quot;Value\u0026amp;quot;: \u0026amp;quot;YmFy\u0026amp;quot;, \u0026amp;quot;CreateIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 7, \u0026amp;quot;ModifyIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 7 } ]  You may be wondering why \u0026ldquo;Value\u0026rdquo; is YmFy. That\u0026rsquo;s because consul uses base64 encoding. Running echo YmFy | base64 -d will give you the string bar.\nRead consul with python requests Awesome, now I can write a fancy python script to show off my foo. Create a file called requestkey.py.\nimport base64 import json import requests URL = \u0026amp;quot;http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv\u0026amp;quot; def requestkey(key): url = \u0026amp;quot;{}/{}\u0026amp;quot;.format(URL, key) r = requests.get(url) data = r.json() v = base64.b64decode(data[0][\u0026amp;#039;Value\u0026amp;#039;]) # FYI v will return a byte instead of a string (b\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;), we\u0026amp;#039;ll decode that to a string return (v.decode()) if __name__ == \u0026amp;#039;__main__\u0026amp;#039;: v = requestkey(\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;) print(\u0026amp;quot;Here is my foo: {}\u0026amp;quot;.format(v))  Run it:\n$ python requestkey.py FETCHED: foo RESULT: b\u0026amp;#039;bar  Live unit test Let\u0026rsquo;s create a test.py file.

As I alluded at the top of my post, I hope to solve this with requests-mock. There\u0026rsquo;s some fancy things I see like registering URIs, but to start, I am just going use the Mocker example they have.

I can develop locally, store working examples in my test code, and test against that.\nRequests is fun, but what about python-consul? The truth is, I don\u0026rsquo;t talk to consul using requests and base 64 decoding. For some reason, I thought it would be easier for you to follow along if I did straight requests. But in reality, most people are going to use python-consul. In fact, here is my getkey.py file doing just that.\nimport consul def getkey(key): c = consul.Consul() # consul defaults to 127.0.0.1:8500 index, data = c.kv.get(key, index=None) return data[\u0026amp;#039;Value\u0026amp;#039;] if __name__ == \u0026amp;#039;__main__\u0026amp;#039;: v = getkey(\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;) print(\u0026amp;quot;Here is my foo: {}\u0026amp;quot;.format(v))  Now I\u0026rsquo;m going to rewrite my test.py to test both of these. I moved my response into the setUp class, renamed test_foo to test_request and added a test_get to test my getkey function.\nimport json import requests_mock import unittest from requestkey import requestkey from getkey import getkey class TestStringMethods(unittest.TestCase): def setUp(self): self.baseurl = \u0026amp;#039;http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv\u0026amp;#039; self.response_foo = [{ \u0026amp;quot;LockIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 0, \u0026amp;quot;Key\u0026amp;quot;: \u0026amp;quot;foo\u0026amp;quot;, \u0026amp;quot;Flags\u0026amp;quot;: 0, \u0026amp;quot;Value\u0026amp;quot;: \u0026amp;quot;YmFy\u0026amp;quot;, \u0026amp;quot;CreateIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 7, \u0026amp;quot;ModifyIndex\u0026amp;quot;: 7}] def test_request(self): key = \u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039; url = \u0026amp;#039;{}/{}\u0026amp;#039;.format(self.baseurl, key) with requests_mock.Mocker() as m: m.get(url, text=json.dumps(self.response_foo)) v = requestkey(\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;) self.assertEqual(v, \u0026amp;#039;bar\u0026amp;#039;) def test_get(self): key = \u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039; url = \u0026amp;#039;{}/{}\u0026amp;#039;.format(self.baseurl, key) with requests_mock.Mocker() as m: m.get(url, text=json.dumps(self.response_foo)) v = getkey(\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;) self.assertEqual(v, \u0026amp;#039;bar\u0026amp;#039;) if __name__ == \u0026amp;#039;__main__\u0026amp;#039;: unittest.main()  Let\u0026rsquo;s see how this does:\n$ python test.py E. ====================================================================== ERROR: test_get (__main__.TestStringMethods) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026amp;quot;test.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 35, in test_get v = getkey(\u0026amp;#039;foo\u0026amp;#039;) File \u0026amp;quot;/Users/ytjohn/vsprojects/unsafe/mocktests/getkey.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 7, in getkey index, data = c.kv.get(key, index=None) File \u0026amp;quot;/Users/ytjohn/.venvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/consul/base.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 538, in get params=params) File \u0026amp;quot;/Users/ytjohn/.venvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/consul/std.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 22, in get self.session.get(uri, verify=self.verify, cert=self.cert))) File \u0026amp;quot;/Users/ytjohn/.venvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/consul/base.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 227, in cb return response.headers[\u0026amp;#039;X-Consul-Index\u0026amp;#039;], data File \u0026amp;quot;/Users/ytjohn/.venvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests/structures.py\u0026amp;quot;, line 54, in __getitem__ return self._store[key.lower()][1] KeyError: \u0026amp;#039;x-consul-index\u0026amp;#039; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 2 tests in 0.016s FAILED (errors=1)  Oh what disaster!

There isn\u0026rsquo;t much pointing to having a block of code produce a static value and then check to see if it is that value. However, when we start taking actions based on values (live, maintenance, true, false, -1), we can definitely check to see if our code behaves an expected way based on a collection of sample data we store. I can also check for how I handle incomplete data. A big part of my microservice correlates devices with network interfaces, ip addresses, and vlans. Not every interface has an ip, not every ip has a vlan. Not every network has a default gateway. I have to determine which ip is \u0026ldquo;primary\u0026rdquo;. So as I collect examples of devices with different configurations, I should be able to register urls and responses for each device. If my code is expecting a vlan to be a number, but instead I receive a \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; - will I handle that or will I throw an exception error?\nLooking forward, I can envision having sample json data stored with functions to provide the desired response and headers needed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/mocking-consul-for-fun-and-profit/","tags":null,"title":"Mocking Consul for fun and profit."},{"categories":null,"contents":" Learning emacs really sucks. Let\u0026rsquo;s do this.\nMy current stack Because I\u0026rsquo;m insane, I decided to give Emacs a try. While I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty pleased with Omnifocus, I do find limitations with it. I also store all kinds of notes in Quiver. Anytime I\u0026rsquo;m working on anything, I keep my notes in Quiver. I had been keeping a worklog in it, but it got goofy when work (and the associated notes) span multiple days. I also use PyCharm as my IDE. That I definitely like, but if I want to open a single file, I\u0026rsquo;m going to pop open vim, sublime text, or even just textedit.\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m looking at Emacs For years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing amazing things about orgmode. It\u0026rsquo;s used for todo lists, project planning, documents, and journals. People also like using emacs as an python ide. Everyone that uses emacs seems to really like it, and it keeps showing up as a good looking solution to different problems I\u0026rsquo;d like to solve. There\u0026rsquo;s even a slack client for it. I decided that I should really give emacs a shot before discarding any solution because it happened to be emacs based. You see, emacs has a super steep learning curve, and when you use it, you essentially join a cult.\nRound 1 So I decided to dive in. I found a number of people recommending How to learn emacs as a good place for beginners. The first page has this juicy tidbit:\n What I need from you is commitment (a couple of dedicated hours of study per week, and to use Emacs as your day-to-day editor) and patience (be willing to give up your favorite IDE’s features, at least for a month or two).\n That\u0026rsquo;s pretty intimidating, but to be fair, Vim takes a long time to master. Those firs starting out need to learn what a modal editor is, how to switch between insert and command mode, how to navigate, how to do search and replace, how to delete lines, and possibly how to use vim\u0026rsquo;s internal clipboard operations. That\u0026rsquo;s all before you get into customizing and extending the program to turn it into an ide.\nI put a couple hours in the first weekend, and a little bit of time the following week going through the examples. But I got bored and real life kept me away.\nRound 2 Seeing sometime ahead of me, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d try again. I went back and forth between plain emacs, spacemacs and prelude. I did research all over about how people got started with emacs. Lots of heavy opinions on \u0026ldquo;starting pure\u0026rdquo;, or using a starter pack like spacemacs/prelude. For those with vim leanings, there is an \u0026ldquo;evil mode\u0026rdquo; that provides some vim keybindings and emulation. I came across the Mastering Emacs book which gots some good feedback on reddit. I started reading a copy of the book with pure emacs open. It\u0026rsquo;s 277 pages long and I got to about page 30 before I started falling asleep. However, here are some key things to know:\n Emacs isn\u0026rsquo;t based on files, but based on buffers (which may contain a file). What we call a window, emacs calls a frame. A frame contains multiple windows (or window panes) You can assign any buffer to any window, or even have multiple windows showing the same buffer.  Round 3 - Just edit some python already Screw reading books and working through tutorials. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to go ahead and start using emacs and then google every time I got stuck. That\u0026rsquo;s how I learned vim back in the late 90s, except I didn\u0026rsquo;t have google back then. In fact, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have Internet at home back then. I had to go to school, search altavista, download manuals and deb packages to floppy disk, then take them home and transfer them.\nI figure, just use the stupid program this week and expect normal operations to take longer while I work things out.\nSo first things first, I took the popular advice and installed spacemacs, which gives me fancy color themes and evil mode.\n If you fire up emacs, it\u0026rsquo;s a decent gui, complete with helpful menus and mouse integration. You can open a file, edit, save it exit almost as easily as any other text editor. File -\u0026gt; Visit new file and File -\u0026gt; Open do make you type in the path the file instead of a file open dialog gui, but there is a sort of autocomplete/directory listing interface. Emacs with spacemacs takes a long time to load. It\u0026rsquo;s on par with pycharm slow load times. Kind of sucks if emacs is closed and you just want to open a file. The one book I says that I should run emacs in a a server mode and just use the emacsclient binary for all subsequent starts. Ok, fine - if I have emacs up all day long, that\u0026rsquo;s doable. Emacs can run a shell. You can run shell which runs your default shell (bash in my case) in a buffer. Emacs fans call this the inferior shell. The \u0026ldquo;emacs shell\u0026rdquo; or shell is promoted as superior. It\u0026rsquo;s a bash-inspired shell written in elisp. Both shells suck. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be able to run a terminal in a window below the file I\u0026rsquo;m editing like I do in pycharm, but it\u0026rsquo;s extremely frustrating working in this shell. Ctrl-C is \u0026ldquo;C-c C-c\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to end up no typing over output from a pervious command. Worst of all, I could not activate a virtualenv in either shell. This means I couldn\u0026rsquo;t drop to a shell and run python ad-hoc python tools. While there may be some amazing tweaks and features these shells bring, I found it much like working on a bad serial connection. When I opened a python file, spacemacs detected this and asked if I wanted to install the python layer. This gave me nice syntax highlighting, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any autocomplete like I was hoping for. I know that \u0026ldquo;helm\u0026rdquo; is enabled, but there is perhaps something else I have to do for autocomplete to work.  projectile for projects Spacemacs bundled an add-on called projectile. This is pretty nice. Incidentally, \u0026ldquo;bbatsov\u0026rdquo; writes a lot of stuff for emacs, including the previously mentioned prelude. People recommend prelude over spacemacs because they feel spacemacs adds could add complexity that could confuse a beginner once they get past the initial learning curve. Ie, spacemacs is good for super beginners, but bad for intermediate users. Or so I\u0026rsquo;ve heard.\nAnyways, this add some nice functionality. Open a file inside a directory that is under git control, and it establishes all files in the directory as a project. If you have all your projects in a directory like ~/projects, you can teach emacs about all them at once.\nM-x projectile-discover-projects-in-directory ~/projects  Once you scan them all, you can run C-c p F to show a list of all known projects and select one to open. Open a file in any project and it puts you in project mode. There are shortcuts to see all files in the project, if you open a shell it drops you in the project directory. You can also quickly switch between recently opened files, perform in-project search and replace.\norg-mode So far, org-mode has been my most positive experience. I wrote up a general outline of a software I\u0026rsquo;m working on and I found it much easier to write with and organize than when I write in markdown.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not markdown, and expecting to be able to use things like markdown code blocks will disapoint you. But it\u0026rsquo;s definitely learnable and I can see myself using it.\nYou just go ahead and open a file ending in .org and start writing. Headers start with * instead of # but otherwise will be familiar to a markdown user.\nThe real nice bit of org mode is as you learn the hot keys and easy shortcuts. Key combinations will create new headings and list entry, or you can move an entire section up, down, indent or outdent.\nIf you type \u0026lt; s \u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt;, it expands to a ‘src’ code block:\n#+BEGIN_SRC #+END_SRC  I only did some basic outlining, but it seemed workable. I can see emacs/orgmode possibly replacing quiver as my primary notebook. It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, because quiver has a this nice feature were you just start writing a note and that note may or may not get a title. There is no need to save that note to a file, because it\u0026rsquo;s saved within the quiver datastore. Emacs will want me to save a file for each note.\nProbably a next step is to test out the orgmode-journal. After that, dive into orgmode and Getting Things Done. If I can put my omnifocus tasks into emacs and use it as a daily work notebook, then this time invested so far won\u0026rsquo;t be entirely put to waste.\nFollow up: I came across this orgmode day planner approach, which seems even more workable than the GTD approach linked above.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/first-impressions-with-emacs/","tags":null,"title":"First impressions with emacs"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Abusing my blog to record a few things. This is kind of a year-end wrap-up before Christmas, or a pre-pre New Years Eve post. I am off work till the end of the year, so this is kind of a good week to reflect and prepare for the upcoming year.\nI cover a couple different things in this post, find the section you want.\n Home Security Cameras Financial Tools (quicken, ledger, hledger, beancount)  Security Cameras tl;dr - I recommend Q-See NVR, refurbished 16-channel for $250 with 2TB drive\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got a few cameras around my house. Two of them are analog cameras on a cheap LA View dvr bought off of woot (I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced it twice). I\u0026rsquo;ve ran zoneminder to pull the RTSP stream from it.\n\nI also have some really cheap ESCAM 720p cameras. These things are amazingly cheap, and can be had for under $40. Zoneminder can pull these in as well.\nThe problem is that I keep finding zoneminder in some broken state. I also am not a fan of the \u0026ldquo;each frame is a file\u0026rdquo; apprach. I\u0026rsquo;ve started using shinobi. I like that better, but feel limited. Also, several times a week, one of the camera feeds goes dark and I have to re-enable it. I got a Windows PC setup and tried out iSpy. GenisuVision, and Xeoma. None of them have really stood out as a great system.\nI decided to try out a more expensive hardware NVR. First I tried an Amcrest NVR, but it couldn\u0026rsquo;t work with any of my existing cameras. Returned. I have a colleague that is a big fan of Q-See Analog DVRs, and the mobile app is pretty slick. I found a good deal on a refurbished 16-channel NVR for $250 with a 2TB hard drive included. This was an instant success. It picked up my ESCAM right away and starts recording.\n  The mobile app is a dream.    I do get higher resolution images, but when scaled for mobile playback and on a screenshot, obviously the resolution suffers.\nDownsides: There is a downside in that accessing it with a web browser sucks - on MacOS it requires Safari and a binary plugin. However, they do have desktop clients for Mac and Windows. Once again, Linux is left out in the cold. I might still end up running Shinobi against the QTSee (or the cams directly) for a simple remote web interface.\nThe other downside is that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get my analog dvr added to the system. This isn\u0026rsquo;t too big of a downer, because I\u0026rsquo;m going to replace those analog 480p cams with the higher quality 720p ESCams (maybe eventually 1080p cams).\nFinances tl;dr - I\u0026rsquo;m going to switch from Quicken to beancount for double-entry plain-text accounting.\nI am planning to get a better handle on my finances in 2018. We\u0026rsquo;re meeting all our bill payments, but I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not where I want to be with knowing where our money is going and planning for the future. For years, I used nothing substantial. I would do some balancing in spreadsheets, or try to use Mint, and I had Quicken for my business. In 2016, I used hledger for about 4 months to track finances. I really liked the concept of plain text accounting, but ultimately ended up purchasing Quicken and using that through the end of 2016 and all of 2017. I can essentially take a Tuesday and sync all my transactions down and reconcile it. In the world of personal finance, there are several camps, but two big ones are those that prefer syncing historical data (mint, quicken) and those that want you to be budget every transaction in advance, such as You Need A Budget and Every Dollar. There is overlap, especially since YNAB and EveryDollar have added syncing to their offerings. Plain Text Accounting/ledger/hledger fall into the second camp, with no sync capabilities.\nThat being said, I have used a program called reckon to import my main bank account into hledger. You go onto your bank website, download a CSV for a certain date range, and import it in. Even with Reckon, it was time consuming, and that\u0026rsquo;s what led me to switch to Quicken. However, after using Quicken for 1.5 years, that can get time consuming as well. My family and I have a handful of credit cards, a mortgage, a car loan, checking accounts, savings accounts, 401k, roth ira, college savings, student loans, and a lot of transactions. For the most part, the bulk of our activity centers around a joint checking account. Just maintaining that one account in Quicken is a big time sink. If I don\u0026rsquo;t update every Tuesday, it can take several hours to catch it up. This is because Quicken might mis or duplicate a transaction from the bank. Or something weird will happen. I might have everything caught up perfectly, and then the next time I\u0026rsquo;m in, I\u0026rsquo;ll discover my balances are off going back 3 months. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to spend time comparing statements and daily balances, going almost transaction by transaction - finding the most recent time when the balances match, then moving forward and fixing whatever caused it to diverge. I\u0026rsquo;ll get things looking correct, then I\u0026rsquo;ll jump forward a month and realize I had missed a divergence somewhere and I\u0026rsquo;ll have to go back. By the time I get the main account squared away, I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like validating all the other accounts. If my Discover card balance is off, then I\u0026rsquo;ll just have to go in an add a BALANCE ADJUSTMENT entry to bring it in line. I was trying to split my loan payments between principal and interest, but that went by the wayside.\nSince I\u0026rsquo;m spending all of this time on Quicken reading every statement anyways, I decided I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be loosing much by going back to ledger. In fact, some banks such as US Bank has stopped offering integration with Quicken. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to start a brand new file and start tracking. This time, I\u0026rsquo;m going to dig around into web scraping. There are a lot of people out there that write tools to automatically log into their bank and download their CSV files. If I can semi-automate their retrieval, that will be a big win. I will also continue to use quickbooks to at least sync the data, but mainly to keep it as a backup if I decide to stop using ledger. I probably will not use it, but there is a quickbook to ledger converter\nWhile I was reviewing hledger, I found another system called beancount. It is another plaintext double-entry accounting system, but it\u0026rsquo;s designed to have less trust in the user entering data. There is a ledger2beancount tool, so I can import any ledger files I had previously or make along the way (though right now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at a fresh start), and beancount itself provides a solid export to ledger.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to start with beancount and see where it takes me. I might bounce a bit between beancount and ledger/hledger along the way. Beancount has some really nice web reports, and their example user in the tutorial sounds rather familiar.\nWorst case, I can drift back to Quicken.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/bits-and-bobs-for-2017/","tags":null,"title":"bits and bobs for 2017"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is a little walkthrough of settng up a \u0026ldquo;production-like\u0026rdquo; vault server with etcd backend (Not really production, no TLS and one person with all the keys).

Erosion has been filling it in, making it hard to get back there with any sort of push mower. Vines and brush have been filling in around it. I did what I could with the trimmer, then I went back in with the machete. Now, this machete was $6 at Harbor Freight and I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it much because the cheap plastic handle was starting to break.\n\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t get a before photo, but one can see the kind of brush I was dealing with slightly up the hill. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before the handle was completely apart. The blade was fine, but the only thing holding the handle on the blade was.. my hand. I eventually ditched the handle, wrapped the base with 550 cord, and was able to finish, though my rope handle too started to unravel.\nLast night I considered that today I would run up to Harbor Freight and pick up another cheap machete. They\u0026rsquo;re $6 and I don\u0026rsquo;t use them that often. But I would really like to be sure that the machete gets through a full job. There\u0026rsquo;s also this adage concerning tools: Buy the cheap one first and if you use it enough to wear it out, then buy a more expensive one. I went and looked on amazon, and they started off around $14. One these, I saw some reviews about the blades bending right away or rusting. Well.. this started me on a pretty dangerous journey to find the best machete to buy.\nMy first step on this journey was a pair of articles on bushcraftpro.com, one focused on clearing brush and another on chopping wood. Both are written by the same author, and follow a similar format (buying a better machete for the husband to use). They certainly opened my eyes to the much larger world of machetes. The machetes that I\u0026rsquo;m used to seeing with a blade and saw on the back are common, but are never in the top of the list. A number of people prefer machetes over hatchets for chopping wood. There\u0026rsquo;s a youtube video showing propper chopping technique. I also learned that \u0026ldquo;the best\u0026rdquo; machete you can get is probably anything by Condor Tool \u0026amp; Knife. From their line, expect to pay around $50 to $90. This was a far cry from $14. I said \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s too much, and this article is bunk\u0026rdquo; and started looking for other opinions. I was awoken to the idea that instead of the hatchet I keep in my car, I might want a machete instead.\nI came across survival prep forums. People making their machete pick based on the impending collapse of society and/or the zombie apocalypse. I learned that machetes are \u0026ldquo;old hat\u0026rdquo; and I should consider Malaysian Parangs or Nepalese Kukris instead. I found the woodmans pal, which looks amazing and has stories off WW2 servicemen using them against enemies with katanas. I discovered Gerber used to make a good machete, but then they lowered the quality, so now it sucks.\nAfter all this research, I went to bed thinking of what kind of awesome machete, Parang, or Kukri I would buy. Something I could keep in the car for brush clearing emergencies, perhaps with a sheath I could hook to my belt. Something I could use while camping or clearing out more brush from around the buildings. I had machete fever.\nThis morning, I woke with a slightly clearer head. I\u0026rsquo;ve used a machete about twice in the last 6 years. I\u0026rsquo;ve only once encountered a fallen tree on the road once that I can recall. In that case, I had no tools to clear it with, but was able to edge the car around it and leave the problem for the next unfortunate traveler. I keep thinking I\u0026rsquo;d like to go camping, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t done that in 20 years. I doubt buying a $80 knife would change that. If anyone learned how much I paid for my expensive knife, they would ridicule me and rightly so after a couple months, I would have forgotten all the details as to why this was so incredible and not be able to justify it other than \u0026lsquo;better handle\u0026rsquo;.\nThis has been about machetes, but it\u0026rsquo;s really a dangerous issue with learning too much. You start looking for something a little better. Then you learn that the one simple tool you never really thought about has an entire world of clashing opinions around it, and suddenly you start identifying with people who (claim to) use that tool for things that you never actually do.\nSo what blade am I planning to get? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet, but I do have it narrowed down.\n The most sensible blade would probably be the $17 Whetstone Machete, recommended in the first brush clearing link above. It is full-tang with a reliable handle. The price is under $20, and it would probably do anything I plan to do it with. The $20 Ontario Knife Co 1-18\u0026rdquo; Military Machete has slightly better reviews than the Whetstone above, but some point out that the handle is a bit slippy. The third (more expensive) choice is available for $40 and is Condor Eco Parang Machete. This is shorter, 11-inch blade and claims to have an unbreakable handle. \u0026ldquo;This tool\u0026rsquo;s high impact Polypropylene handle is strong and indestructible. These handles are molded directly into the machetes and knives blades making them impossible to separate\u0026rdquo;. It only has 11 reviews on Amazon, but after watching this youtube video and seeing them go from \u0026ldquo;meh\u0026rdquo; to impressed while chopping wood, shaving wood, and clearing brush. They mention the longer Condor Bushcraft, which is about $10 more. The Condor Eco Golok as reviewed by the same guy can be gotten for $35 and also looks pretty impressive. I think I like the Eco Parang a bit more.

YourTech.us and YourTech Community now live on a dedicated VPS. YourTech.us is now using WordPress, though all content is still generated in Markdown. Soon, other sites will migrate as well.  Launching A New Site Over the course of this last week (really a good bit of this year) I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a lot more web work. In February, I launched Nifty Noodle People, an event website to promote BCARS\u0026rsquo;s rebranded Skills Night 2.0. After trying many, many different systems, I settled on WordPress. WordPress is something I moved away from back in 2012. However, for a single purpose site, WordPress really impressed me. It impressed me so much, that I decided that I should redo BCARS site under wordpress as well. I had been using Mezzanine, Django-based CMS to manage their site and mine. But Mezzanine has been showing its age and often causing more problems than it\u0026rsquo;s worth when it comes to doing updates or adding things like an event calendar.\nBCARS Changes I setup a BCARS development wordpress site and started importing content into it. I spent a lot of time looking at different calendars. For Nifty Noodles, I had used The Events Calendar, and it\u0026rsquo;s a really nice calendaring system. But when I was trying to utilize it for BCARS, I ended up not liking the formatting options. I went back into research mode and ultimately settled on time.ly. I even picked up their Core+ package which lets me re-use vendors and organizers. This let me add in recurring events like meetings and weekly nets, and it allows people viewing the site to filter between regular and featured events (like a VE session).\nAs I was secretly working on this, it was brought up at a club meeting that the club would like to see a way to buy and sell gear on the site. So I added bbPress forum to the development site. Then I launched it silently on April 24th. It has gotten pretty solid reviews from people visiting it.\nServer Move As I was doing all this work, I observed that my Dreamhost VPS was prone to crashing. I also made an alarming discovery that I was paying a lot more each year than I had remembered. Also, I often get issues with it running out of memory and getting rebooted. I decided it was time to go searching. I had stuck with Dreamhost because of their nice control panel. They made it easy to spin up new sites, sub-domains, and \u0026ldquo;unlimited\u0026rdquo; everything. But it\u0026rsquo;s time to move on.\nI looked at web hosts, then I looked at plain VPSes. I discovered that OVH had some really good pricing on SSD VPSes. A couple years ago, I would have bulked at \u0026ldquo;wasting time\u0026rdquo; managing a server in order to do something simple like pushing web content. But my skills with config management have come a long way over the last 5 years. I decided I would use Ansible to manage the VPS and use all the myriad of roles out there to do so. I\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully write more on that later. But in short, I\u0026rsquo;ve got roles installing mongodb, mysql, nginx, letsencrypt, and managing users. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a suitable role to manage nginx vhosts, especially in a way to start with a vhost on port 80, and not clobber the information letsencrypt puts in when it acquires a certificate. I hope to make a role that maintains http and https config separately, only putting in the https configuration if the certificate files exist.\nBut I digress.\nCommunity Forums During all this, I have been giving lots of thought to moving YourTech to wordpress as well. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit more challenging because I write all my notes in Markdown, which I then convert into posts. I started markdown blogging in 2012, and have shifted platforms several times since, most recently on Mezzanine. I was also thinking of better ways to engage the audiences of YourTech, BCARS, and Nifty Noodles. I had come across this article about replacing Disqus (which I had used) with Github comments. While I liked the idea, I knew it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work for my goals. I kept coming back to forum software. I found three modern variations Discourse, NodeBB, and Flarum. Of the three, I like Flarum the best. Unfortunately, Flarum is still under heavy development and not recommended for production use. The authors can\u0026rsquo;t yet guarantee that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to preserve data through upgrades. They want the flexibility to make changes to the database structure as they develop features. So I went to the next best, which is NodeBB.\nNodeBB has a blog comments plugin that allows you to use a NodeBB to handle comments on your blog. The pieces all started coming together. I installed NodebB on my VPS as https://community.yourtech.us/. I changed the links on BCARS forums to point to this new community site, and integrated comments for BCARS.\nYourTech Move This weekend, I decided to pull the plug on YourTech.us and migrate it simultaneously into wordpress and into the new server. I new this would cause downtime, but since my blog is not commercian, and not exactly in the Alexa Top 500, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too concerned. If anyone did notice downtime between the 5th and 7th, let me know below.\nThe move was not without hitches. I did have a markdown copy of all my posts, but I had to add yaml frontmatter to the top of them for github wordpress sync to work. Then I discovered that the plugin ignores my date and just makes all my posts match the time of the sync. Also, using the same repository I had been using in development caused issues as well. But eventually, I got all my posts imported with their original post date.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t import was my resume and personal history. My contact page I did import, but it is rather out of date, so I feel I should update it soon. I want to rethink what I have on all three pages and how I present them, so that\u0026rsquo;s a future project.\nFinally, I discarded the handful of disqus comments I had and integrated the comment system with YourTech Community.\nFuture Plans  I still need to migrate BCARS, Nifty Noodle People, and other sites away from Dreamhost. But I hope those moves will be pretty painless since it will be direct copy and DNS change. I made YourTech.us look similar to how it did before the move, but I am not sure I\u0026rsquo;ll keep that look going forward. Once Flarum becomes more production like and they build a NodeBB importer (and comment integration), I\u0026rsquo;ll quite possibly move to that. Ultimately, I hope these changes will motivate me to write more frequently, now that I can easily post from my phone or web.

I used to keep some individual files around with a list of ip addresses and networks, and I used to have a yaml file with the network laid out. But a lot of it was out of date and any time I made a significant change (like adding vlans or tagged interfaces), the entire format would need to change. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been planning to redo how my network is laid out and realized I would have to document everything before I could really work on the new scenario. But overall, these projects have been at the very bottom of the list, kind of kicked under the rug.\nThis weekend, I got a big itch to go back and figure out how everything was laid out physically, and document it. I decided I just wanted to grab a tool, even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the ideal do everything tool, and start recording things. So Saturday night and early Sunday morning, I started re-researching network documentation tools. I was pretty dissapointed by what I found, at least in the open source world.\nLet me explain my home network setup. I have the house, my batcave/office, and a shed. These all are networked together, and each building has a managed switch in it. I have cable internet coming into the house. From the comcast router, a wire goes into a managed switch on a \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; vlan. My gateway router sits in the batcave is also plugged into a managed switch on the same vlan. I have 4U wall-mount racks holding patch panels (and/or switches) a 40U rack in my batcave holding the gateway router, a switch, and a couple servers. I also have some unifi access points spread around the property.\nTo start off, I came up with a list of what I wanted to do:\n Enter in all of my physical devices  servers racks patch panels switches access points routers  Record the connection between each device. Note the native and tagged vlans on each switch port Possibly record server ip addresses, virtual machines, and their vlans (native or tagged) Be able to fetch my data by api, and ideally programatically enter Be able to view a rack elevation or cable path  What I did not want to do:\n Use a homemade file like a spreadsheet or yaml file (even though people have done wonders with making elevation spreadsheets) Write an application to do this Lock my data into an obscure format  Research Spoiler Alert As you can guess from the title, I ultimately installed openDCIM and used that. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet all of my needs, but I\u0026rsquo;ll explain my reasoning below.\nAfter searching, I came up with there being several categories that touch upon these areas. They are 1) asset/inventory management, 2) network scanning and monitoring.\nNetwork Scanning and Monitoring: Applications in this category, such as opennms and solarwinds npm work by interrogating your network and building a live map of everything connected. In reality, this is what most people, including myself should look at. The reason network documentation gets out of date is because someone is manually entering it. By providing a live report of the network (and showing historical changes in an audit log), you will always have the most accurate information. Looking at software in this category had me re-evaluate what I wanted to do. I was looking heavily at openNMS (and I\u0026rsquo;ve come across this product in the past). Here, the NMS stands for Network Management Solution, though they have a lot of focus on monitoring, so you might assume the \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Monitoring\u0026rdquo;. openNMS looks excellent for what it does, and I will probably use openNMS down the road for my logical network documentation. But for what I wanted to do, openNMS and applications in this category are not designed to physically lay out hardware. There was nothing in openNMS about rack elevations or cable connectiosn that I could find. I even found people in forums looking for a way to integrate openNMS with Racktables (mentioned below).\nLike I said, looking at applications in this category made me want to further separate my goals to target the physical layout. Some software can do live polling of switches to see what MAC addresses are connected to a port, and things like lldp will show friendly neighbor names. But it can\u0026rsquo;t tell that there is a patch panel or unmanaged switch in between. The only way to get this information is visual inspection. I need an application that can do that.\nAsset and Inventory Management: These also overlap with Config Management Databases. In fact, a number of IT Asset Managers also call themselves CMDBS, or vice versa. IT Asset Management is a pretty wide area. However, only a couple support concepts like rack elevations and cable path management. The two I looked at the most were RackTables and opendcim. A third one I looked at was Ralph.\nRalph: Let me just talk about Ralph for a moment. I looked at Ralph two years ago for a larger project at work, and it was disqualified for a number of reasons, specific to that project. That experience gave me a negative view of Ralph, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t give it too much looking over this time around. That may have been unwise. I took a second look while writing this up. If you look at their documentation, they seem to have all the features I\u0026rsquo;m looking for here, along with an API. It\u0026rsquo;s based on python/django, and their github is pretty active. I think I owe it to Ralph to install and review the software again. A lot seems to have changed over the last two years. UPDATE: I went and played with Ralph\u0026rsquo;s demo. Very slick addings datacenters, server rooms, racks, and devices. If I go to add a device, I can create a new device template and manufacturer on the fly. However, it has no support for cable management. There is an ongoing issue opened for this. So even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t give Ralph a fair shake, it\u0026rsquo;s out of the running for right now because it can\u0026rsquo;t do links between interfaces.\nRacktables: I\u0026rsquo;ve used racktables off an on over the years. Quite frankly, it\u0026rsquo;s just not nice software to work with. Data entry is difficult, it has no native api support (though some people have worked at bolting some on), and in my mind, it\u0026rsquo;s a one-way system. You put the data in and that\u0026rsquo;s about it, you can only visually access the data afterwards. On the plus side, it does have some IPAM and VLAN management features, so for those looking to do more than physical layout, Racktables has quite an advantage.\nopenDCIM: Finally, we come to openDCIM. Like Racktables, it\u0026rsquo;s php/mysql based. It has a rather nice interface for creating datacenters, cabinets, and devices. It understands about chassis and blade setups. It has a baked in read-only API. These days, my philosophy on web apps is that they should build an api, and then a frontend that uses that api. But this app pre-dates the popularity of APIs, and they have been adding it on afterwards. I would have been turned off by the lack of writeable API, but their existing html forms are basic enough that you could easily manipulate them with curl or python. If I really needed to update the data programatically, I am sure I could do so. But being able to run a curl command and get data back in json, means that I can easily integrate this with other tools down the road. Ultimately, I decided I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to waste this motivation trying to seek out other tools and went with openDCIM. My goal for Sunday was to record what I could about the system.\nActual Usage installation/vagrant Installation was pretty straightforward. I did it inside a vagrant vm on my laptop. It was basically install Apache, PHP, Mysql and go to town. I uploaded my vagrant config to github, so you can clone that and start your own instance right away. After installation, opendcim provides a web-based pre-fight check and walks you through creating datacenters and cabinets. This is pretty straightforward - you just give your datacenters a name, and your cabinets a name and u-height. Once done, you have to manually delete install.php from the opendcim directory.\nFor me, I called my batcave one datacenter, and my house another. Then for each room, I made that a cabinet. In my basement, I have a 4U network rack on the wall, and a rack shelf also screwed into the wall (holding my synology and my comcast router). I called my shelf a 10U rack. Then for each room that has a wall jack and any equipment (like an access point) I wanted to track, I created an imaginary rack. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about that in a bit. Now, at work, we use rack names like R01 or NP01 or A54. At home, I used highly technical names like \u0026ldquo;basementwallrack\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tvstand\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;batcaverack\u0026rdquo;. Pick a naming scheme that works for you.\nenter manufacturers and templates One of the first things I came across was that I can\u0026rsquo;t just add a device to a rack. Devices are based on device templates, and templates are tied to a manufacturer. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a surprise, because almost any sort of asset tracker I\u0026rsquo;ve used works the same way. This means that I had to go into my Template Management, and add manufacturers. Then I went into Template Management and start editing templates. This was a fun excercise going into my emails, amazon orders, or just logging into a device to get a model number. In a template, you can define things like power consumption, weight, network ports, and u-height. These are templates, so you won\u0026rsquo;t be putting serial numbers in. I added templates for my managed switches, my ubiquiti UAP and UAP-AC-PRO, 24v poe injectors, my chromebox, generic desktop computer, patch panels, and anything else I could think of. There was a neat looking feature where you could import templates and submit templates back, but none of the existing ones had my equipment. If you have images of the front and back of a device, you can include those to make your rack elevations look more accurate.\nOne quick gothca was that when I started adding devices with network ports, I found I had to go into configuration-\u0026gt;cabling types and add cable media types like 1000BaseTX and 1000BaseFX. For fun, I added 802.11bgn along with 802.11ac. I also added a 1000BaseTX-POE24V medie type, because I have some runs that are carrying 24V POE.\nOne useful to do when making templates is to go down to the Ports and rename them to things like \u0026ldquo;eth0\u0026rdquo;. For my access ports, I made \u0026ldquo;LAN\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;WLAN\u0026rdquo; ports. For the POE injector template, I put \u0026ldquo;LAN\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;POE\u0026rdquo; as port names. You can always rename ports when you create a specific device to put in a rack, but the better your template, the less work later on.\nAlso, the device type is important. Most of the types (servers, storage arrays, and appliances) all work the same way. Physical Infrastructure does not have any ports. Patch Panels are unique in that each port ends up having a front and rear connection.\nadding devices and connecting ports Finally, you can browse to a rack and start adding devies. When you add a device, you select from a template, add a label, and then select a u position. when you save that, you can then start connecting ports. I found it best to start with patch panels first. I have 24-port patch panels in each wall-mounted network rack. I had to get creative for the wall jacks, and I made either 1-port or 2-port RJ45 keystone jacks (RJ4KJ1 and RJ45KJ2). When connecting patch panels (or wall jacks) make sure that you connect the rear of one patch panel to the rear of another. When editing a port, you can \u0026ldquo;connect\u0026rdquo; the front and rear side of the port at the same time. So you can connect the front of the patch panel to a switchport, and the back of your patch panel port to the back of a wall jack, and then hit save.\nI found that saving connections seemed straightforward, but was easy to make mistakes. After you have entered each row and clicked save on it, you need to hit \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; to save all of your changes. Also, if you don\u0026rsquo;t save your rows before hitting update, your changes will be lost. I also found that once I linked two ports, I could no longer change the name of the ports. Once you make connections, you can see the entire path in an image form, or in a text description like this; SW02BATCAVE[Port4]BATCAVE-PATCH24[Port4]BC2[BC2-2]FRESHDESK[eth0].\nAs for IP addresses and multiple interfaces, this was sadly lacking. I could enter a management address for a device. On the ports, there is a notes column. I could add an ip address or a vlan bit there, but it\u0026rsquo;s simply a free-form field.\nsnmp When adding switches, if I added an ip address, I could query the switch with snmp. On my tp-link switches, it was able to get basic system information over snmp, but it could not get a list of ports. If it had, I believe it can populate some port status information.\nimaginary racks and other oddities As I mentioned above, I had to make imaginary racks in each room. The imaginary racks were sort of a pain point for me. I get that this program was written with racks in mind. The concept of a freestanding device such as a celing mounted access point, a wall jack, a printer, or a desktop tower just really doesn\u0026rsquo;t factor in. The idea is that you have racks, and only devices that are in a rack can be cabled.\nThis also impacted how I made wall jacks. A single port wall jack, I had to enter as a patch panel, 1U in height. If a device does not have a U-height, you can\u0026rsquo;t add it to a rack. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t add it to a rack, you can\u0026rsquo;t cable it. So, in order to document the RJ45KJ1 and RJ45KJ2, I created two 10U racks in my living room. \u0026ldquo;TVSTAND\u0026rdquo; with a 1U RJ45KJ1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;LRCOUCH\u0026rdquo; with a 1U \u0026ldquo;RJ45KJ2\u0026rdquo;. For TVSTAND, I added my tp-link unmanaged switch, my UAP-AC-PRO, and (for fun), my Chromebox. The switch connects to the front of the RJ45KJ1. The Chromebox connects to the unmanaged switch.\nMy access point provided another hitch. This might be a bit obsessive, but I want to record when something is using POE. So I created a Ubiquiti 24VPOEINJECTOR appliance template, which I used to create a (1U) device to place in my imaginary rack. One port (LAN) connects to the switch, while the other (POE) connects to the access point.\nFor my living room, since the POE lives with the access point, this isn\u0026rsquo;t really needed. But for the access point in the hallway, the poe injection takes place in the basement, and we have a 1000BaseTX running from the switch to the injector, then 1000BaseTX-POE24V running to the front of the patch panel, then from the rear of the patch panel, to the keystone jack in the wall, and finally up to the access point. I have a similar setup in my batcave, with a POE injector powering an external access point, and another (48V!) powering an ip phone. While POE is supposed to be safe for non POE devices, I think it comes in handy to document which wall jack I can expect to find power at.\nWrap Up This about wraps up my experience. Over the course of a Sunday, I was able to get openDCIM up and running, and enter all the data that describes the physical layout of my network. I would love to be able to wire up freestanding devices in a data center, and I would like to assign ip addresses and vlans to individual interfaces. But for physical layout and inventory, it works really well. I suspect that another application like openNMS will have to track my logical network. If it can be configured to query my switches (snmp/lldp), then it would be a better live solution. Ralph might be a good system for handling this aspect as well, though that requires further investigation.\nOnce all the data was in, I was able to do curl commands and retrieve json. Since references to other devices were id numbers, a true fech and sync would need to make multiple calls, retrieving related records. For visualization, openDCIM has a reports feature, including a network map. This network map is generated using graphviz dot language, and it can output that in png or svg. The default generated map is a bit difficult to trace lines from port to port. But I took the dot file, changed splines to ortho and it came out much nicer. I think there\u0026rsquo;s room for improvement here, and I think with some tweaking, we can make a really nice printable network diagram to hang up next to each rack.\nAnother feature that might be nice would be printable asset labels, that have a QR pointing back to the opendcim instance.

One of them is to write more blog posts. This post is the first step towards that. Rather than just naming off a few common resolutions, I spent a couple days working through the exercises in Alex Vermeer\u0026rsquo;s 8,760 Hours: How to get the most out of next year. In my opinion, this is an excellent book. The author and myself used mind-mapping software, but this is also very doable using pencil and paper. I did end up using Mindjet MindManager (trial) for mind, but I am going to switch it over to FreeMind. MindManager is (in my opinion) much more expensive than I anticipated and I can\u0026rsquo;t justify the cost. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Freemind in the past and found it adequate.\nYou spend a good bit of time making a snapshot of \u0026ldquo;where you are now\u0026rdquo;. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow his guide exactly (I didn\u0026rsquo;t, it is in fact, a \u0026ldquo;guide\u0026rdquo;), but you start with breaking your life down into 12 areas and adding details for each area. Some areas will be hard numbers or metrics, such as how much you have saved for retirement, or how much you weigh and what you think your goal weight should be. For instance, I did 7 blog posts in 2015 and only 3 in 2016. Others will more thought provoking like \u0026ldquo;what fun things have I done recently?\u0026rdquo; or describing your home life.\nAs you can imagine, the life snapshot is going to be a pretty personal thing, not something you\u0026rsquo;d want to share out. But it does make you think about your life as a whole. It\u0026rsquo;s also nice to have some of the metrics that you can compare to when next year comes around.\nOnce you have built the snapshot, the second portion of the exercise is to actually set your goals. Much like making your current snapshot, Alex recommends splitting your goals into \u0026ldquo;life areas\u0026rdquo; and organizing your goals under each section. You should also give thoughts on how you might go about accomplishing these goals and add details underneath each goal. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to make a full detailed plan. This \u0026ldquo;goal map\u0026rdquo; is going to be something that you can save or print out and refer to during the year. The entire thing should fit on the equivalent of one page and you would be able to see all of your goals and ideas towards accomplishing them at a glance. You can always use other specific tools to draw up a budget, record your diet, or design a sail boat as you work towards your goals.\nFinally, the author recommends doing both monthly and quarterly reviews of your goals. Ask yourself if you\u0026rsquo;re on track. Some goals may be more important than others. My goal to get my credit card balances back to $0 (and pay them off each month) is more important than my goal to build out 3 APRS stations and replace the 2nd garage door on our pole barn (it has been disabled/nailed shut since we moved in).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/welcome-to-2017/","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to 2017"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Worst Practice Lab VM Automation I\u0026rsquo;ve started the process of switching my lab over from unmanaged to ansible. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Puppet and Salt quite extensively through work, but after a handful of false starts with the lab, I think ansible is the way to go.g his is a series of what many (including myself) would consider \u0026ldquo;worst practices\u0026rdquo;, but are more along the lines of \u0026ldquo;rapid iteration\u0026rdquo;. The goal here is to get something working in a short period of time, without spending hours, days, or weeks researching best practices. This is instead something someone can put together on a Sunday afternoon, in between chasing after a 3 year old.\nThese are a handful of manual steps, each of which could be easily automated once you determine your \u0026ldquo;starting point\u0026rdquo;.\nBackground: When I clone a VM in proxmox, it comes up with the hostname \u0026ldquo;xenial-template\u0026rdquo;. I should be able to do something like I do with cloud-init under kvm, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten that far under the proxmox setup. Additionally, these hosts are not in dns until they are entered into the freeipa server. Joining a client to IPA will automatically create the entry. So the first thing I need to do to any VM is to set the hostname, fqdn, and then register it with IPA. My template has a user called \u0026ldquo;yourtech\u0026rdquo;, which I can use to login and configure the VM.\nFirst, create an ansible vault password file: echo secret\u0026amp;gt; ~/.vault_pass.txt. Next, create an and inventory directory and setup an encrypted group_vars/all.\nmkdir -p inventory/group_vars touch inventory/group_vars/all  Add some common variables to all:\n--- ansible_ssh_user: yourtech ansible_ssh_pass: secret ansible_sudo_pass: secret freeipaclient_server: dc01.lab.ytnoc.net freeipaclient_domain: lab.ytnoc.net freeipaclient_enroll_user: admin freeipaclient_enroll_pass: supersecret  Then encrypt it: ansible-vault --vault-password-file=~/.vault_pass.txt encrypt inventory/group_vars/all\nGenerate inventory files. With the following script, I can run ./add-new.sh example 192.168.0.121. If ansible failes, then I need to troubleshoot. A better approach would be to add these entries into a singular inventory file, or better yet, a database, providing a constantly updated and dynamic inventory. Put that on the later pile.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash NEWNAME=$1 IP=$2 DOMAIN=lab.ytnoc.net FQDN=\u0026quot;${NEWNAME}.${DOMAIN}\u0026quot; ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSFILE=~/.vault_pass.txt BASEDIR=~/projects/ytlab/inventory FILENAME=\u0026quot;${BASEDIR}/${NEWNAME}\u0026quot; LINE=\u0026quot;${FQDN} ansible_host=${IP}\u0026quot; export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False echo ${LINE} \u0026amp;gt; ${FILENAME} echo \u0026quot;Removing any prior host keys\u0026quot; ssh-keygen -R ${NEWNAME} ssh-keygen -R ${FQDN} ssh-keygen -R ${IP} echo \u0026quot;${FILENAME} created, testing\u0026quot; ansible --vault-password-file ${ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSFILE} -i ${FILENAME} ${FQDN} -m ping -vvvv  Let\u0026rsquo;s go to work. At this point, I should have a working inventory file for a single host and I\u0026rsquo;ve validated that ansible can connect. Granted, I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested sudo, but in my situation, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that will work. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually done anything with the VM. It\u0026rsquo;s still just this default template.\nFQDN Ansible provides a module to set the hostname, but does not modify /etc/hosts to get the FQDN resolving. As with many things, I\u0026rsquo;m not the first to encounter this, so I found a premade role holms/ansible-fqdn.\nmkdir roles cd roles git clone https://github.com/holms/ansible-fqdn.git fqdn  This role will read inventory_hostname for fqdn, and inventory_hostname_short for hostname. You can override this, but these are perfect defaults based on my script above.\nFreeIPA Once again, we\u0026rsquo;re saved by the Internet. alvaroaleman/ansible-freeipa-client is an already designed role that installs the necessary freeipa packages and runs the ipa-join commands.\n# assuming still in roles git clone https://github.com/alvaroaleman/ansible-freeipa-client.git freeipa  The values this module needs just happens to perfectly match the freeipa_* variables I put in my all file earlier. I think that\u0026rsquo;s just amazing luck.\nMake a playbook.

I would probably rewrite these roles I downloaded to make them more flexible and variable driven.\nIn case you got lost where these files go:\n. ├── add-new.sh ├── bootstrap.yml ├── inventory │ ├── group_vars │ │ ├── all │ ├── pgdb01 │ ├── pgdb02 │ └── sstorm01 └── roles ├── fqdn └── freeipa  ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/worst-practice-lab-vm-automation/","tags":null,"title":"Worst Practice Lab VM Automation"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The two key components:\n Ceph OSDs: A Ceph OSD Daemon (Ceph OSD) stores data, handles data replication, recovery, backfilling, rebalancing, and provides some monitoring information to Ceph Monitors by checking other Ceph OSD Daemons for a heartbeat. A Ceph Storage Cluster requires at least two Ceph OSD Daemons to achieve an active + clean state when the cluster makes two copies of your data (Ceph makes 3 copies by default, but you can adjust it). Monitors: A Ceph Monitor maintains maps of the cluster state, including the monitor map, the OSD map, the Placement Group (PG) map, and the CRUSH map. Ceph maintains a history (called an “epoch”) of each state change in the Ceph Monitors, Ceph OSD Daemons, and PGs. Ceph uses the Paxos algorithm, which requires a consensus among the majority of monitors in a quorum. With Paxos, the monitors cannot determine a majority for establishing a quorum with only two monitors. A majority of monitors must be counted as such: 1:1, 2:3, 3:4, 3:5, 4:6, etc. Side note: some ceph docs advise not to comingle Montior and Ceph OSD daemons on the same host or you may encounter performance issues. But in deployment guides and the Mellanox high performance paper, they do comingle them. For all test purposes, I plan to comingle them (deploy monitor on ecs nodes) and evaluate performance under load. I am also still trying to estimate how many monitors per Ceph OSD. We\u0026rsquo;ll have 480 Ceph OSDs per rack, and we\u0026rsquo;ll want either 3, 5, or 7 monitors. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a shot in the dark and go with 5. RADOS GW This is what provides the S3 and SWIFT API access to Ceph file storage. You can install this on the OSD nodes (simplest) or select a handful of external VMs to run these. You would setup multiple RADOS GW nodes, and place a load balancer like haproxy or nginx/lua_proxy in front of them.  OSD Notes: OSD Journal Location: stores a daemon\u0026rsquo;s journal by default on /var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id/journal - on a ECS node, this would be an SSD, which is recommended by CEPH. However, you could point it to an SSD partition instead of a file for even faster performance.\nOSD Journal Size: The expected throughput number should include the expected disk throughput (i.e., sustained data transfer rate), and network throughput. For example, a 7200 RPM disk will likely have approximately 100 MB/s. Taking the min() of the disk and network throughput should provide a reasonable expected throughput. Some users just start off with a 10GB journal size. For example: osd journal size = 10000\nOSD\u0026rsquo;s can be removed gracefully: http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/add-or-rm-osds/#removing-osds-manual\nCheck Max Threadcount: If you have a node with a lot of OSDs, you may be hitting the default maximum number of threads (e.g., usually 32k), especially during recovery. You can increase the number of threads using sysctl to see if increasing the maximum number of threads to the maximum possible number of threads allowed (i.e., 4194303) will help. For example: sysctl -w kernel.pid_max=4194303\nCrush MAP The \u0026ldquo;location\u0026rdquo; of each Ceph OSD is maintained in a CRUSH MAP.\nThe CRUSH algorithm determines how to store and retrieve data by computing data storage locations. CRUSH empowers Ceph clients to communicate with OSDs directly rather than through a centralized server or broker. With an algorithmically determined method of storing and retrieving data, Ceph avoids a single point of failure, a performance bottleneck, and a physical limit to its scalability.\nCRUSH maps contain a list of OSDs, a list of ‘buckets’ for aggregating the devices into physical locations, and a list of rules that tell CRUSH how it should replicate data in a Ceph cluster’s pools. By reﬂecting the underlying physical organization of the installation, CRUSH can model—and thereby address—potential sources of correlated device failures. Typical sources include physical proximity, a shared power source, and a shared network. By encoding this information into the cluster map, CRUSH placement policies can separate object replicas across different failure domains while still maintaining the desired distribution. For example, to address the possibility of concurrent failures, it may be desirable to ensure that data replicas are on devices using different shelves, racks, power supplies, controllers, and/or physical locations.\nThe short of this is that in ceph.conf, you can define a host\u0026rsquo;s location, which subsequently defines the location of each Ceph OSD operating on that host. A location is a collection of key pairs consisting of Ceph predefined types.\nroot=default row=a rack=a2 chassis=a2a host=a2a1 # types (from narrowest ascending to broadest grouping) type 0 osd type 1 host type 2 chassis type 3 rack type 4 row type 5 pdu type 6 pod type 7 room type 8 datacenter type 9 region type 10 root  Each CRUSH type has a value. The higher this value, the less specific the grouping is. So when deciding where to place data chunks or replicants of an object, Ceph OSDs will consult the crush maps to find other Ceph OSDs in other host, chassis, and racks. The fault domain policies can be defined and tweaked.\nhttps://ceph.com/planet/zero-to-hero-guide-for-ceph-cluster-planning/ https://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/whitepapers/WP_Deploying_Ceph_over_High_Performance_Networks.pdf - High performance ceph builds.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ceph-getting-acquainted/","tags":null,"title":"Ceph getting acquainted"},{"categories":null,"contents":" title: Ceph 1st Runthrough author: ytjohn date: 2017-04-30 21:42:52\nlayout: post permalink: https://new.yourtech.us/?p=34\nThese are just some notes I took as I did my first run through on installing Ceph on some spare ECS Hardware I had access to.

If you want to see my python program that calculates out the diode matrix, skip to the end or click here,\nI recently received this \u0026ldquo;Force Communications AMH-350\u0026rdquo; radio. Actually, it was an entire cabinet with a large power supply, an MFJ TNC2 tnc, and an old DOS PC running JNOS. These had active in a tower shed and turned off 3 years ago. The club wanted me to repurpose this packet system for APRS.\nOnce I plugged it in, the computer booted up to JNOS, but the radio and TNC did not turn on. The power supply had a plastic box on the back with a larger bussman 30A fuse. When I pulled it out, corrosion dust leaked out. I made a trip to the hardware store and replaced it. The radio turned on but not the TNC. On the front I found 3 smaller fuses and a note describing that \u0026ldquo;F3\u0026rdquo; ran the TNC. Pulled that fuse out and it was dead. A second trip to the hardware store got this fuse replaced. Then I plugged everything back in and turned on the power supply. Within 10 seconds, the \u0026ldquo;make it work smoke\u0026rdquo; had leaked out of the TNC2. This is probably why the F3 fuse had blown in the first place. This was disappointing, because there is new firmware for the TNC2 that makes it a decent APRS TNC, no computer needed.\nThe computer, I deemed too old to run a soundcard packet (using direwolf as my driver), so this left me with the power supply and radio. Grounding out the PTT line and using a frequency counter, it showed me \u0026ldquo;channel 2\u0026rdquo; was transmitting on 145.050. Channel 1 was not programmed at all.\nA quick google search told me that Uniden bought Force Communications and sold this radio as a Uniden AMH-350. I found 2 other people looking for how to program it (one in 1994, and the other in 2004) with no response. I found someone selling the radio\u0026rsquo;s manual on ebay for $20. I offered them $10 and received the manual earlier this week.\nThe radio itself is programmed with a common cathode diode matrix, representing a binary value. Here is a picture of one back side of it programmed for 145.050. The manual provides a table covering frequencies from 148Mhz to 174Mhz in 5khz increments. Fortunately, it provides a formula on how to come up with your own frequencies. I ran through this formula multiple times getting different results from the book, till I realized the book was rounding some values UP or outright disregarding fractional parts. It also took a bit to wrap my head around binary \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; being disconnected (or cut) and binary \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; being connected. That felt backwards to me.\nEventually though, I was able to match the book, create a chart that matched the existing programmed 145.050 frequency (both Tx and Rx, which are programmed separately). Then, I wrapped the whole thing up in a set of python functions inside an ipython notebook. You can view this on ipython\u0026rsquo;s nbviewer or the direct gist.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the radio programmed yet. I feel getting the diode matrixes out of \u0026ldquo;channel 2\u0026rdquo; and still having them useful for programming with is going to be difficult. I will need 7 diodes connected for each Tx and Rx slot, 14 total. I am attempting to program up channel 1. By the time I got to this portion, I was a bit tired and making mistakes, so I called it a night. Once I get to building out the programming board, I\u0026rsquo;ll post some more pictures.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/programming-uniden-amh-350-for-aprs-2/","tags":null,"title":"Programming Uniden AMH-350 for APRS"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Recently the internet noticed the Raspberry Pi could drive LCD panels using DPI.

I'm not the only one. Essentially, these days if your chat service is not done over HTTP(s), and if it doesn't have persistence, your chat service is now legacy. Yes, I still enjoy IRC, and I think it's great for ephemeral communications. But in this multi-device, mobile world, it's hard to use IRC as a daily driver for my friends and coworkers. Several months ago, I started looking into chat systems again for a different reason than most - amateur radio. There's this thing in amateur radio called Broadband-Hamnet, which is a wireless mesh network. It's not the first mesh system out there, but it has a really good initiative behind it. The idea behind it is that all nodes are configured to use the same SSID and the network is self configuring. If I stand up a node here at my house, someone else, having never spoken to me before, could deploy a node within range of mine and the two would connect. They would be able to see the node, any services I offer, and use them. DNS and service advertising is built in. I wanted to come up with some \"generic\" mesh nodes with a connected server (raspberry pi). The idea that you could grab a couple of these boxes, deploy them in the field and operators would be able to share files, chat, and even video. The big catch was that you never knew what systems would be online at any given time.\nI looked into standing up an IRC server with a web front end. This had a problem in that no historical messages would be synchronized during a netjoin. There are a number of P2P chat systems, though most of these require some sort of \"bootstrap\" system. Even worse, for an amateur radio system under FCC regulation, most of these are focused around encryption. Tox.im would be a good choice, except it would violate the no message obscuring rule of FCC part 97 that governs the Amateur Radio service.\nI even started conceiving of a system based on the idea of a pub/sub message queue, except json over http. Nodes would subscribe to a channel and any message posted to a channel would get propagated to all the subscribing nodes. Using twisted, I could also create gateways for standard IRC or XMPP clients. Well fortunately for me (and you) a group went out and did just that, only much much better than anything I could have put together. Matrix.org has put together a federated chat specification. The concept is really simple - json over http(s). They have a reference implementation called Synapse that is written in twisted. People run homeservers of synapse and will join channel. A channel is shared between all homeservers that subscribe to it and all channel events are propogated until consistency is achieved. This means that if a homeserver joins the channel late, or goes a way for a while, it will eventually achieve a complete history of all message events within the channel.\nIf you run your server on the default port of either 8008 for HTTP or 8448 of HTTPS, the only DNS record you need is an A record. If you use another port like 443, then you add a DNS SRV record stating the host and port (just like with XMPP).\nWhile the project still has a few rough edges, it is definitely usable today. The most stable implementation is on matrix.org but you can also join my homeserver at matrix.ytnoc.net.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/enter-the-matrix/","tags":null,"title":"Enter the Matrix"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Every morning I wake up bleary eyed\nAnother victim of aggressive deadlines\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think this is supportable\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not good at all\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nTrying to save the build but never really done\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nNothing more than that, that\u0026rsquo;s all I really am\nJust an all day job, there\u0026rsquo;s so much left to do\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kinda hard when everything fails on you\nTry to make it look easy, gonna make it look good\nLike anybody would\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nTrying to save the build but never really done\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nNothing more than that, that\u0026rsquo;s all I really am\nI\u0026rsquo;m just like everybody else\nAfter all the hype it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell\nI keep my game face on so well\n\u0026lsquo;Cause I\u0026rsquo;m just your average, ordinary, everyday super admin\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to save the build\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to find my token key\nAnd no one knows it\u0026rsquo;s really me\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really me, it\u0026rsquo;s really me\nOh, yeah\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nTrying to save the build but never really done\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nNothing more than that, that\u0026rsquo;s all I really am\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to save the build\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nYeah, yeah\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nTrying to save the build but never really done\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\nNothing more than that, that\u0026rsquo;s all I really am\nI\u0026rsquo;m just your average ordinary everyday super admin\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/everyday-superadmin/","tags":null,"title":"Everyday Superadmin"},{"categories":null,"contents":" All about git pull Because you know\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull \u0026lsquo;bout git pull\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear, I ain\u0026rsquo;t no guru\nBut I can break it, break it\nLike I always do.\nAnd now I got that pull request, that we all want.\nWith all the right code in all the right places.\nI see that manual push with rsync\nWe know that shit aint right\nIt caused my script to stop.\nIf you got fixes fixes, just check \u0026lsquo;em in\nSo every line of code is peer reviewed\nfrom the bottom to the top\nYeah, my coworker he told me don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the style\nHe says \u0026ldquo;We just need a little more testing to make it right.\u0026rdquo;\nYou know I won\u0026rsquo;t trust the logs to /dev/null\nSo if that\u0026rsquo;s where you put them then you better use syslog.\nBecause you know\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull, no copies\nI\u0026rsquo;m all about git pull\n\u0026lsquo;bout git pull\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/all-about-git-pull/","tags":null,"title":"All about git pull"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Completely unrelated to the post below, I discovered that some has forked a copy of my website on github.

It has a number of things I like from Ansible (separation from code and state), the targeting abilities of mcollective, and the centralized control of Puppet/Chef. Salt can be run masterless, but in a master/minion configuration, it uses a message queue (0mq) to control minions and get information back. All messages in this queue are encrypted using keys on both the minion and the master. If you distribute this key, you can consume salt generated data in other programs.\nRunning commands across all minions could look lik this:\nsalt '*' test.ping salt '*' disk.percent  In these, test.ping and disk.percent are known as \u0026lsquo;execution modules\u0026rsquo;, which are essentially python modules that contain defined functions. For example, disk would be an \u0026lsquo;execution module\u0026rsquo; and \u0026ldquo;percent\u0026rdquo; would be a function defined. Here, test.ping runs on all target hosts and returns \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo;; disk.percent returns the percentage of disk usage on all minions.\nYou can also run ad-hoc commands.\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'ls -l /etc'  Of course, you can target blocks of systems by hostname (web* will match web, web1, web02, webserver,..). Salt also has something called Grains which everyone else calls facts. You can target based on the grains, or use salt to provide a report based on the grains. The following command will return the number of cpus for every 64-bit cpu.\nsalt -G 'cpuarch:x86_64' grains.item num_cpus  I think this would work as well:\nsalt -G 'cpuarch:x86_64 and num_cpus:4' test.ping  If not, these would work (Compound match):\nsalt -C 'G@cpuarch:x86_64 and G@num_cpus:4' test.ping salt -c 'G@os:Ubuntu or G@os.Debian' test.ping  Salt States In Puppet, your manifests and modules are very closely coupled in puppet code. In Ansible, they separate things into modules and \u0026ldquo;playbooks\u0026rdquo;. These playbooks are yaml files detailing what modules and values for ansible to use. Salt follows this pattern as well, separating execution modules from states with \u0026ldquo;Salt States\u0026rdquo;, aka SLS formulas (aka state modules).\nA sample SLS formual for installing nginx would look like this:\nnginx: pkg: - installed service: - running - require: - pkg: nginx  Assuming you save that in the right spot (/srv/salt/nginx/init.sls), you can apply this state module to all servers starting with the name \u0026lsquo;web\u0026rsquo;.\nsalt 'web*' state.sls nginx  So with one tool, you can query a large amount of data from all your minions, move them to a specific state, run ad-hoc style modules, etc. This can also all be expanded by writing your own python modules. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m mostly interested in the ability to target modules and groups of hosts in one command, but it\u0026rsquo;s worh noting that salt will do scheduling of jobs just like puppet and chef do.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/salt-the-earth/","tags":null,"title":"Salt The Earth"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is a quick note log. I was able to setup a self-hosted web IDE for programming. Today I tested out codebox.io, but I also want to check out the open source Cloud9 IDE.\n Codebox.io an open-source Web IDE for programming (in your browser) Docker an open source container Docker-Codebox. All I really want is this guy's Dockerfile.  I already have Docker installed, that's the easy bit.\nBuild the box: git clone https://github.com/forty9ten/docker-codebox.git cd docker-codebox docker build -t ytjohncodebox . # much building occurs  Run codebox in docker This will run the codebox.io environment on port 8000 and you'll be editing files that are stored in a directory called workspace1. ~/workspace1 on the host gets mounted into /workspace1 in the container.\ncd ~ mkdir workspace1 docker run -p 8000:8000 -v ./workspace1:/workspace1 -t ytjohncodebox -p 8000 run /workspace1 # many things happen # I end up seeing this: # Codebox is running at http://localhost:8000  Now, I can access my server on port 8000 (ie, http://192.168.1.32:8000/). This instance is unprotected, it just asks for an email to get started. But the part I skipped over is that I am actually using nginx to proxy and password protect this instance. I can hit Ctrl+C on the terminal to cancel my instance and all my edited files are safely stored in ~/workspace1.\nInteresting bits: I create a new file in the web browser and save it, I see this bit of json in the console output:\n[events] watch.change.create : { change: 'create', path: '/irule.txt', stats: { current: { dev: 64513, mode: 33188, nlink: 1, uid: 0, gid: 0, rdev: 0, blksize: 4096, ino: 262847, size: 27, blocks: 8, atime: Wed Feb 26 2014 05:18:44 GMT+0000 (UTC), mtime: Wed Feb 26 2014 05:18:42 GMT+0000 (UTC), ctime: Wed Feb 26 2014 05:18:42 GMT+0000 (UTC) }, old: null } }  One thing I really need is the ability to open a web terminal. When I do though, the terminal window appears for a few seconds, and then vanishes. In the console, I see this:\n[log][shells.stream] new socket connected [log][shells.stream] open shell { shellId: 'term2020-44', opts: { rows: 80, columns: 24, id: 'term2020-44' } } [log][events] shell.spawn : { shellId: 'term2020-44' } [log][events] shell.attach : { shellId: 'term2020-44' } [log][events] shell.open : { shellId: 'term2020-44' } [log][events] shell.exit : { shellId: 'term2020-44' } [log][shells.stream] socket disconnected [log][shells.stream] socket disconnected [log][hooks] use hook settings  I got this same issue going through my nginx proxy and connecting directly on port 8000. A bit of text flashes quickly on the \"terminal\" in the web browser, but closes too quickly for me to catch it. Perhaps it's attempting to run something that is not installed in the Docker instance. If I can fix that, then I just need to come up with a cool way to launch workspaces and tie them into my nginx setup (or switch over to hipache as my front-end webserver).\nAnyways, just wanted to record these steps here and show how easy it could be to get your own self hosted IDE.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/codebox-in-docker/","tags":null,"title":"Codebox in Docker"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Acer C270 Chromebook Last week I picked up a Chromebook, specifically the Acer C270. One of my coworkers uses one and kind of convinced me that one would be worth checking. I compared what was out there and other than the Pixel, the C270 had the best specs, including battery life (8.5 hours). It\u0026rsquo;s an Intel chipset, 16GB space, 2Gb of RAM, 1.4Ghz.\nThe good:  You get a lot of functionality for $200. 7 seconds from power off to browser up and running. Both an ssh client and vim are installed by default. The keyboard is fairly responsive. Runs forever without needing a charge. You can install a real OS alongside ChromeOS (using Crouton) and switch between the two without rebooting. It can do web pages and has a built in terminal shell. With Ubuntu installed in a chroot environment, it does everything my regular computer does (and I almost never have to fire up the gui, which would be a battery drain). This does Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and I haven\u0026rsquo;t done this, but one could replace the drive with a 128GB SSD for $100.  The bad:  Unfortunately the SD card slot isn\u0026rsquo;t very deep. Any SD Card you insert will stick out the side. I was hoping to drop a 64GB sdcard inside here and store videos/music/projects on this card. But since it sticks out so far, I might as well use a USB drive. The trackpad requires an annoying amount of pressure to right click or click and hold (dragging/highlighting). It also makes a loud click when you do this.  After working on this for the last week, I decided that this Chromebook is exactly what I was hoping my Asus 904 netbook would be. A responsive, long lasting, carry anywhere type computer. It has made me regret purchasing my Nexus 7. I get a lot more daily use out o fthe 11\u0026rdquo; Chromebook.\nSo what am I using this for? A lot of things. Anything really. My primary use case for this was actually amateur radio. In my ubuntu chroot environment, I installed CHIRP to program my radios, flidgi for operating digital modes, xlog for QSO logging, and Wine+APRSISCE for APRS action. So far these programs seem to work without issue. I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to program radios, send PSK data to PSKDroid on my cell phone using acoustic coupling, and view APRS activity using APRSISCE. When I\u0026rsquo;m not doing ham radio activity, I leave the X-windows session shut down (and it only takes about 5 seconds to start it up again).\nBeyond ham radio, I\u0026rsquo;m using it to browse the web (duh), ssh into my servers, write python code, and right now\u0026hellip; writing this post. Earlier today I fired up a Jenkins server on AWS. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to set one up for a long time, and I have a year of AWS\u0026rsquo;s free tier currently. So from this chromebook, I selected a jenkins instance from the AWS market, SSH\u0026rsquo;d into and add pelican to it. Then I was able to setup a simple jenkins job that would publish my website from github. Then I went over to github and added a commit hook that calls my new jenkins job. Now, anytime I commit into my website\u0026rsquo;s github repository (including editing it from github directly), jenkins will automatically publish it. Doing this on my tablet, even with the keyboard, would have been frustrating.\nBasically, despite even Google\u0026rsquo;s marketing, their Chromebook is NOT a web browser only type device. It is a full computer. If you\u0026rsquo;re used to Linux desktops and servers, you can do anything on it that you can on your existing setup. Yes, the impressive battery life is obtainable by using ChromeOS and using X-Windows or other cpu heavy applications will bring that battery life down. But even when I left X-windows up for long periods of time (for instance, letting the linux side download updates) it only had a moderate impact on my battery life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a \u0026ldquo;carry anywhere, do anything\u0026rdquo; computing device, the C270 is well worth the price.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/c270-review/","tags":null,"title":"C270 Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I ordered the KS2 from  - $50/month, 3.4ghz, 16gb ram, and a 1TB software raid setup. My plan is to set this up as a single server virtual datacenter. They also have the SP2 with twice the ram and storage for $90, but I figured I\u0026rsquo;d test out the cheaper option first. I can always upgrade and migrate to a larger server later if I get into heavier usage. The prices are rather cheap and they have scripts that will automatically provision physical servers.\nI had this installed with Centos 6. I tried first using the \u0026ldquo;ovh secure\u0026rdquo; kernel, but I could not get KVM working with that kernel, so I had it reinstalled with the \u0026ldquo;vendor\u0026rdquo; kernel. I allocated 20GB to \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; and the remainder (898GB) to \u0026ldquo;/data\u0026rdquo;.\nInstalling kvm and libvirt is a simple yum command.\nyum install kvm libvirt python-virtinst qemu-kvm  Then, on my workstation, I installed virt-manager, which allowed me to graphically create and install virtual machines (I can do this by hand on the server, but virt-manager is a nice way to get started). The connection is done over ssh, so it will either ask for your username/password, or it can use ssh-key authentication (preferred).\nI created /data/isos and /data/vms to hold my installation isos and virual machines respectively. The trick I had to work out is that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just add \u0026ldquo;/data\u0026rdquo; as a directory-based storage volume, I had to make one for isos and one for vms. I also found that the default directory (/var/lib/libvirt/images) is rather difficult to remove. I disabled it and removed it, but it showed back up later. When creating through the dialog, virt-manager wants to put your vm image in \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;.\nCreating a new virtual machine using virt-manager and a downloaded ubuntu 12.04 iso image (in /data/isos) was rather slick. I created a new volume in /data/vms, set the memory and cpu and started it. The default networking is a NAT\u0026rsquo;d network in the 192.168.122.x/24 network. As ovh only provides 3 IP addresses for free, I\u0026rsquo;m content to start with this network for testing, but I plan to move to a different subnet mask.\nIf I need to nat ports, the libvirt site has a useful page on forwarding incoming connections.\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport HOST_PORT -j DNAT --to $GUESTIP:$GUESTPORT iptables -I FORWARD -d $GUESTHOST/32 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport $GUESTPORT -j ACCEPT  I have been reading some good things about The Formean, and how you can manage an infrastructure with it, so my next real VM will be an install of foreman. This will hopefully let me setup an enviroment where I can build virtual machines and provision them automatically. I don\u0026rsquo;t know (yet) if The Foreman will handle iptable rules on the host, but it seems to have the ability to call external scripts and be customized, so I should be able to provision NAT on the host when provisioning a new VM.\nForeman utilizes DHCP and PXE to install \u0026ldquo;bare metal\u0026rdquo; VMs, so we need a network without DHCP. Now, to create my non-dhcp managed nat, I copy the default network xml file and modify it with my new range and remove the dhcp address\ncd /usr/share/libvirt/networks cp default.xml netmanaged.xml  Modified netmanaged.xml:\n\u0026lt;network\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;managednat\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bridge name=\u0026quot;virbr1\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;forward/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ip address=\u0026quot;172.16.25.1\u0026quot; netmask=\u0026quot;255.255.255.0\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ip\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/network\u0026gt;  It should show up with virsh net-list --all and I can activate it.\n# virsh net-list --all Name State Autostart Persistent -------------------------------------------------- default active yes yes managednat inactive yes yes # virsh net-autostart managednat Network managednat marked as autostarted # virsh net-list --all Name State Autostart Persistent -------------------------------------------------- default active yes yes managednat inactive yes yes # virsh net-start managednat Network managednat started # virsh net-list --all Name State Autostart Persistent -------------------------------------------------- default active yes yes managednat active yes yes  The gateway will be 172.16.25.1, and I will assign the IP 172.16.25.5 to my Foreman virtual machine, aptly called \u0026ldquo;builder\u0026rdquo;. Once the basic ubuntu machine is installed by hand (hopefully the last one we do in this environment), I\u0026rsquo;ll want access to it. Ideally, this would be behind a firewall with vpn access, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t got that far yet. So for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll just setup some NAT for port 22 and 443.\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8122 -j DNAT --to 172.16.25.5:22 iptables -I FORWARD -d 172.16.25.5/32 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8143 -j DNAT --to 172.16.25.5:443 iptables -I FORWARD -d 172.16.25.5/32 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  Using \u0026ldquo;foreman-installer\u0026rdquo; is the most recommended method, ensuring that we have current packages directly from theforeman.org. I\u0026rsquo;ve installed 12.04 LTS (precise), so it\u0026rsquo;s fairly straightforward, though I modified slightly from the installation documentation. The original instruction rely on running as root.\n# get some apt support programs sudo apt-get install python-software-properties # add the deb.theforeman.org repository sudo bash -c \u0026quot;echo deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ precise stable \u0026gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.db/foreman.list\u0026quot; # add the key wget -q http://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add - # install the installer sudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get install foreman-installer # run the installer sudo ruby /usr/share/foreman-installer/generate_answers.rb  At this point, Foreman is running on port 443, or in my case \u0026ldquo;https://externalip:8143/\u0026quot;. I can login with the username \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; and the password \u0026ldquo;changeme\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the manual more at this point, but I think my next step is to watch the video Foreman Quickstart: unattendend installation. If I can grok that (and it looks nicely step by step) I\u0026rsquo;ll try and setup an unattended install.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/foreman-managed-virtual-datacenter/","tags":["a:1:{i:0;s:49:\"a:1:{i:0;s:31:\"foreman, puppet, libvirt, virsh\";}\";}"],"title":"Foreman managed virtual datacenter"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This weekend I decided to takle both learning Ruby and working with AWS via the Ruby API.

I know any time I wanted to create a two-column layout, I would have to look at previous works of mine or search the Internet for a decent example. However, I recently came across Twitter\u0026rsquo;s Bootstrap framework. At it\u0026rsquo;s core, it\u0026rsquo;s just a css file that divide your web page into a 12-column \u0026ldquo;grid\u0026rdquo;. You create a \u0026ldquo;row\u0026rdquo; div, and inside that row you place your \u0026ldquo;span*\u0026rdquo; columns. Each span element spans from 1 to 12 columns, and should always add up to 12 for each row. You can also offset columns. There are css classes for large displays (1200px or higher), normal/default displays (980px), and smaller displays such as tablets (768px) or phones (480px). Elements can be made visible or hidden based on the device acessing the site (phone, tablet, or desktop). There is also a javascript component you can use for making the page more interactive.\nIf you download bootstrap, you get a collection of files to choose from. There\u0026rsquo;s js/bootstrap.js, img/glyphicons-halflings.png, img/glyphicons-halflings-white.png, css/bootstrap.css, css/bootstrap-responsive.css. There is also a compress .min. version of the javascript and css files. You can read further about the responsive version of the css, or how to use the icons.\nNormally, one would take these downloaded files and put them into their own web application directory tree. However, there is a better way. Unless you are planning to use this on an Intranet with limited Internet access, you can use a copy of these files hosted on a \u0026ldquo;content delivery network (CDN)\u0026rdquo;. A good example of this is the jQuery library hosted on Google\u0026rsquo;s CDN. Google has a number of hosted libraries on their network. This has several advantages, one of which being caching. If everyone is pointing at a common hosted library, that library gets cached on the end-user\u0026rsquo;s machine instead of being reloaded on every site that uses that library.\nWhile bootstrap is not hosted on google, there is another CDN running on CloudFlare called cdnjs that provides a lot of the \u0026ldquo;less popular\u0026rdquo; frameworks, including bootstrap.

When experimenting with python commands and modules, it\u0026rsquo;s usually easiest to use the python console interactively, then create your programs later. The downside of this is that sometimes you have to do a bit of typing before you get to the specific command you want to try.\nImagine the following example:\njohnh@puppet2:~$ python Python 2.7.3 (default, Aug 1 2012, 05:14:39) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. \u0026gt;\u0026gt; from pysphere import * \u0026gt;\u0026gt; server = VIServer() \u0026gt;\u0026gt; server.connect(\"vc1.example.com\", \"username\", \"password\") \u0026gt;\u0026gt; print server.get_server_type(), server.get_api_version() VMware vCenter Server 5.0  Here, I had to type in 3 lines, including my password in plaintext, to test out querying the server. I can\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate this live, because then I reveal my password. Well last week, I made a [test1.py] file that reads a yaml configuration file and does the commands I just did. Here\u0026rsquo;s the smart bit. I can import that file directly into the python console. Once it imports, it runs each python command and leaves me in the console, ready to query the system again.

Everything (except console) that you can do in the vSphere client, you should be able to do through a web-based API.\nUnfortunately, it seems that VMWare does not provide an SDK for Python, my current language of choice. I could work in Perl or Java, but I want to develop a web application, which I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do in Perl. Fortunately, I found pysphere, which is a fairly active project of implementing the VI API in python. It might not fully implement the API, but it looks relatively stable and easy to implement. Plus, if I find any functionality missing, I can extend the class directly.\nI followed their Getting Started page to get it installed and get connected, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like having my password right there in my working code.

Redmine is officially provided by Ubuntu, but the version for Precise is 1.3.2, and Ondřej\u0026rsquo;s PPA is on 1.4.3. While I usually prefer to have my software installation and updates handled by packages, it looks like to get to the 2.x series, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to go back to source.\nI will be following the official upgrade guide closely, but with a few variations.\n The apt-get/ppa version uses multiple file locations for source code and configuration.

The Gemfile includes items for postgresql and sqlite, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it. The install guide lets you know that you can skip these with the \u0026ndash;without option.

One of the main reasons for this was because in my last server move, I had broken my Movable Type installation, and found myself too busy to fix it. I found I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend my time fixing and updating blogging software. I wanted to work on my projects, write them up, and post them. It was time to move my content to an existing platform that handled the back end. I looked at a few, and decided blogger.com would be as good as any other service.\nIt only took a short time to setup a blog, point a CNAME at it, and then to import my existing posts. When I started creating some new posts, I immediately ran into some limitations. \n You used to be able to edit permalinks on blogger. Now, you can only do that before you publish. The only way to change a permalink after publishing is to create a new post with the desired permalink and delete the old one. Blogger has no built in formatting for code blocks. So if I want to show a config file, source code, or terminal session log, I have to fiddle with changing fonts, size, and \"blockquote\" to get it presentable. Even then, you run the risk of strange formatting of your raw text.  I found a solution that other bloggers use called SyntaxHighlighter. This is a combination of javascript and css code that takes text within your\n; tags and gives you nice looking blocks of code, highlighted and (optionally) with line numbers. The catch is that your pre tags need to have a class name, along with the language (perl/c/bash/text) \"brush\" to use. If you go with pre tags, you have to change any angle bracks to their HTML escaped equivalents of \u0026lt; and \u0026gt;. They have a work-around using SCRIPT/CDATA, but it takes some getting used to. Adding this to your blog only requires a few steps.  I rather liked syntaxhighlighter, but it still seemed like I had to do a lot of manual work with the code. Also, I had to select the brush each time. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t it guess? Notepad++ and some others will guess at what language you\u0026rsquo;re using and highlight accordingly. I found something called prettify that does just that. You only need to load one js file and one css file. Prettify works off of either\n or tags and has similar limitations to SyntaxHighlighter regarding html tags. However, it has the advantage of being able to guess the language automatically.  Being able to use this code made my posts look much nicer, but the entire process got me thinking. The way I \u0026ldquo;document\u0026rdquo; most of projects typically invole using a notepad editor like Geany or Notepad++. As I work, I add notes, copy in source code or shell comands, and do everything in a plain text editor. Later, I add commentary and clean up the document. I take this and paste it into the WYSIWYG editor on blogger. Finally, I have to keep switching between compose and html mode to get my text looking suitable. There are too many steps for me to want to do this consistently. All I really want to do is take my text file, add a little formatting in a few spots, a few hyperlinks in others, and post it.\nEnter markdown. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). I have used this before, but didn\u0026rsquo;t pay it close enough attention. It\u0026rsquo;s used on github and reddit, there are plugins for it in dokuwiki and redmine. The idea is you write in text, adding formatting using the markdown syntax. This format is both human readable and machine readable. When read by the appropriate library, clean html is generated. It also has a feature for wrapping blocks of code inside of \n\u0026amp;;lt;code\u0026gt; tags and html-escaping html inside of those tags.  Within the MarkDown project is a paged called \u0026ldquo;dingus\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;placeholder\u0026rdquo;. You can paste your markdown text into one textarea and get the generated html plus a preview back. I tested pasting that generated html into Blogger\u0026rsquo;s HTML box and it seems to work perfectly fine. What this means is that I can type up my documentation completely within my text editor of choice, save it locally, and then generate my html code to paste into blogger.\nSome of you may have realized that my \n tags are missing that class name (. Well, I copy the generated html, do a search and replace of with and then paste it, but that's adding more steps. Instead, I sought to make my own dingus that does this automatically. I found that there is an extension of markdown called Markdown Extra written in PHP. Extra adds a few features such as simple tables, but remains consistent with original Markdown formatting. Using that library, I was able to create my own dingus rather easily and alter the tag with one line of code $render2 = str_replace(\"\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\", \"\u0026lt;pre class=\"prettyprint linenums\"\u0026gt;\", $render);. In my experimentation, I made a parser that reads a text file and outputs html, and three dingus parsers. Dingus1 does straightforward conversion of markdown extra to html. Dingus2 and 3 provide the class names for prettified code, with #3 going the extra step of applying stylesheets for the preview.  With this setup, I can quickly paste in my text document and pull html code to paste into blogger.com\u0026rsquo;s html edit box. With some more research, I can modify the dingus to interact with blogger\u0026rsquo;s API and post on my behalf. There are also some WYSIWYM live editors that show you an instant render of your markdown as you type (you type in a textarea while your html renders in a nearby div). This would be a good way to do some tweaking to the markdown text before posting the html to the web. My next plans are to make a better dingus, possibly with a live preview and a \u0026ldquo;post to blogger\u0026rdquo; option.\nSome other links: \n http://balupton.github.com/jquery-syntaxhighlighter/demo/ http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/wiki/PageDown http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/examples/markdown/  ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/markdown-blogging/","tags":null,"title":"Markdown Blogging"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Yesterday, I setup gateone to run as a non-root user. I also spent some time looking at potential init scripts for starting and stopping this. The gateone project does not currently provide any init scripts, but this is planned for the future ([Issue #47]). I tried to use one of the scripts in that thread, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really pleased with them. The big issue is that gateone.py doesn\u0026rsquo;t fork. However, I believe there is a better solution.\nsupervisord is a python script designed to control and monitor non-daemonizing python scripts. As Gate One is a foreground only process, it seems particularly suited to this task - more so than writing my own script in python or daemontools.\nInstallation can be done with python-pip or easy_install. On newer systems, pip is recommended.\nsudo pip install supervisor  On Ubuntu, pip installs supervisord to /usr/local/bin. By default, /usr/local/bin is not in root\u0026rsquo;s path, so it makes sense (to me at least) to create symlinks to /usr/sbin.\njohnh@puppet2:~$ ls /usr/local/bin echo_supervisord_conf pidproxy supervisorctl supervisordjohnh@puppet2:~$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/supervisord /usr/sbin johnh@puppet2:~$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/supervisorctl /usr/sbin  Now, we need to create a configuration file. Supervisord has a utility to generate a sample one.\necho_supervisord_conf \u0026gt; supervisord.conf  To get started, we can use the sample configuration and just add a couple lines to the bottom for gateone.\n [program:gateone] command=/opt/gateone/gateone.py directory=/opt/gateone ;user=johnh ; Default is root. Add a user= to setuid  Now, copy supervisord.conf to /etc/supervisord.conf and start supervisord. Make sure gateone.py is not currently running. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll run supervisorctl to test things out.\njohnh@puppet2:~$ sudo cp supervisord.conf /etc johnh@puppet2:~$ sudo supervisord johnh@puppet2:~$ sudo supervisorctl status gateone RUNNING pid 9549, uptime 0:00:05 johnh@puppet2:~$ ps ax | grep gateone 9549 ?

If we restart gateone.py, we can connect to it again and have our sessions resumed. While we could probably configure supervisord to kill these terminals, I believe we\u0026rsquo;d normally want to keep them running. The few times I would want to stop those terminals would be a) manually reconfiguring/troubleshooting opengate, b) updating software, or c) rebooting the server. For a\u0026amp;b, running the command \u0026ldquo;gateone.py -kill\u0026rdquo; will kill those terminals. For a server shutdown or reboot, the act of shutting down the OS will kill these terminals.\nFinally, we need a way to start and stop supervisord itself. Fortunately, the supervisord project has provided a number of init scripts. I was able to use the Debian script in Ubuntu with only a few minor changes.\n I had symlinked supervisord and supervisorctl to /usr/sbin. The script expects them in /usr/bin (but even says that /usr/sbin is a better location). I had to change /usr/bin to /usr/sbin. Alternatively, you can symlink the files into /usr/bin I added a status option that runs $SUPERVISORCTL status If you started supervisord manually, you must shut it down and start it with the script. The script won't be able to stop supervisord unless /var/run/supervisord.pid is current.

This is an open-source, web-based ssh terminal. It is capable of multiple users, sessions, and bookmarks. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a number of AJAX terminals or Java applet based ones in the past. The javascript ones usually did not have very good terminal emulation, while the Java apps worked, but worked just like a local desktop app (making it\u0026rsquo;s own connection to port 22). Gate One uses WebSockets, allowing for full duplex communication through your web browser over the same port 80 or 443 used to serve up the web page.\nInstallation Gate One is a python application using the Tornado framework. As such, at runs independently of an existing web server and handles connections from browsers internally. If you already have a web server running on your system, you will need to tell Gate One to use a different IP or a different port.\nInstallation using pre-built binaries or the source is fairly straightforward and detailed in the documentation.\nThe installer creates a directory of /opt/gateone and places all necessary files there. You can run it by changing to that directory and running gateone.py as root.\njohnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ sudo ./gateone.py [W 120801 13:52:06 terminal:166] Could not import the Python Imaging Library (PIL) so images will not be displayed in the terminal [W 120801 13:52:06 gateone:2232] dtach command not found. dtach support has been disabled.

Pressing Ctrl If you conect to gateone using your webbrowser, you are logged in as user ANONYMOUS and can connect to any ssh host, either localhost or something remote.\nIf you edit /opt/gateone/server.conf, you can change authentication to \u0026ldquo;pam\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;google\u0026rdquo;. Using pam will perform a Basic HTTP style authenication requiring a system-level username and password. Using google will log you in with your google account. Both of these \u0026ldquo;just work\u0026rdquo; without complicated setup.\nRunning as a Non-Root Before I put something like this in production, I wanted to apply some additional security. First off, I want to see if I can get this to run as a non-root user.\nSince gateone ran as root user initially, it has files owned by rootOnly UID 0 can open ports below 1024.gateone may need permission to write to system directories\nTo solve the first one, I chowned the /opt/gateone directory to my username. In the future, I\u0026rsquo;ll want to run it under its own user, but I\u0026rsquo;ll use mine for now for simplicity. To solve the second and third, I edited server.conf.\njohnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ sudo chown -R johnh:johnh . johnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ vi server.conf# change/add the following lines appropriatelyport = 2443session_dir = \"/opt/gateone/tmp/gateone\"pid_file = \"/opt/gateone/tmp/gateone.pid\"uid = 1000gid = 1000 johnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ ./gateone.py [W 120801 14:06:01 terminal:166] Could not import the Python Imaging Library (PIL) so images will not be displayed in the terminal [W 120801 14:06:01 gateone:2232] dtach command not found. dtach support has been disabled.

If you use \u0026ldquo;pam\u0026rdquo;, you discover you can only login with the username that gateone is running under. If you are the only intended user of the service, this may not be an issue. But if you want to allow other users, this becomes an issue. If you are fine with running as root or using Google as your authentication provider, you can ignore this next step.\nFortunately, pam is highly configurable. You aren\u0026rsquo;t required to authenticate against shadow passwords. You can also authenticate against db4 files with pam_userdb, msyql, or even htpasswd files. To start off, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use htpasswd files. Note that Ubuntu doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide pam_pwdfile.so by default. You need to install libpam-pwdfile (\u0026ldquo;sudo apt-get install libpam-pwdfile\u0026rdquo;).\nNote - in testing, I discovered gateone uses Crypt encryption while htpasswd defaults to MD5. Use -d to switch to crypt encryption. johnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ htpasswd -c -d users.passwd user1 New password: Re-type new password: Adding password for user user1 johnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ cat users.passwd user1:KKEPyZtUf9sadf9  Create a pam module called gateone under /etc/pam.d\njohnh@puppet2:/opt/gateone$ cat /etc/pam.d/gateone #%PAM-1.0 # Login using a htpasswd file @include common-sessionauth required pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile /opt/gateone/users.passwdaccount required pam_permit.so  Modify server.conf to use pam and pam_service of gateone:\nauth = \"pam\" pam_service = \"gateone\"  Now start gateone and log in.\njohnh@puppet2:~/g1/gateone$ ./gateone.py [W 120801 14:59:16 terminal:168] Could not import the Python Imaging Library (PIL) so images will not be displayed in the terminal [W 120801 14:59:16 gateone:2577] dtach command not found. dtach support has been disabled.

One additional nice feature with authentication enabled is the ability to resume sessions - even across different computers or browsers.\nReverse Proxy (I failed on this part, but felt it was worth recording)\nOnce I got it working in single user mode, I wanted to go ahead and set this up under a reverse proxy under Apache. This would allow me to integrate it into my existing web server under a sub-directory.\nFirst, I edited server.conf to use a URL prefix of /g1/\nSecond, I tried setting up a ReverseProxy in Apache.\n# GateOne ProxySSLProxyEngine OnProxyPass /g1/ https://localhost:2443/g1/ ProxyPassReverse /g1/ https://localhost:2443/g1/ ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain localhost localhost ProxyPassReverseCookiePath / /g1/  This almost worked. I had no errors, but the resulting page was unreadable. However, at the bottom was a clue. \u0026ldquo;The WebSocket connection was closed. Will attempt to reconnect every 5 seconds\u0026hellip; NOTE: Some web proxies do not work properly with WebSockets.\u0026rdquo; The problem was Apache not properly proxying my websocket connection. People have managed to get this working under nginx, but not Apache.\nSearching for a solution led me to a similar question on ServerFault, an apache-websocket module on github, and a websocket tcp proxy based on that module.\n http://serverfault.com/questions/290121/configuring-apache2-to-proxy-websocket https://github.com/disconnect/apache-websocket http://blog.alex.org.uk/2012/02/16/using-apache-websocket-to-proxy-tcp-connection/  In order to get this work, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to download and compile some code. The apxs command requires the apache-prefork-dev package in Debian/Ubuntu. Install it with \u0026ldquo;sudo apt-get install apache-prefork-dev\u0026rdquo;.\nNow we are ready to download the code and install the module:\njohnh@puppet2:~$ git clone https://github.com/disconnect/apache-websocket.git Cloning into 'apache-websocket'..... done johnh@puppet2:~$ wget http://blog.alex.org.uk/wp-uploads/mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.tar.gz johnh@puppet2:~$ cd apache-websocket johnh@puppet2:~/apache-websocket$ sudo apxs2 -i -a -c mod_websocket.c*snip* johnh@puppet2:~/apache-websocket$ sudo apxs2 -i -a -c mod_websocket_draft76.c*snip* johnh@puppet2:~$ cd examples johnh@puppet2:~$ tar -xzvf ../../mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.tar.gzmod_websocket_tcp_proxy.c johnh@puppet2:~$ cd apache-websocket/examples/ johnh@puppet2:~/apache-websocket/examples$ sudo apxs2 -c -i -a -I.. mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.c *snip* chmod 644 /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.so [preparing module `websocket_tcp_proxy' in /etc/apache2/mods-available/websocket_tcp_proxy.load] Enabling module websocket_tcp_proxy.To activate the new configuration, you need to run:service apache2 restart johnh@puppet2:~$  Before we restart, I want to remove my Proxy lines and replace them with the mod_websocket_tcp_proxy lines.\nSetHandler websocket-handler WebSocketHandler /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.so tcp_proxy_init WebSocketTcpProxyBase64 on WebSocketTcpProxyHost 127.0.0.1 WebSocketTcpProxyPort 2443 WebSocketTcpProxyProtocol base64  Despite all this, I was still unable to get this to work. I even attempted using the web root (/) as my location. If the Location matches and your HTTP request is handled by mod_websocket, you get a 404. If you use Proxy, then your websocket request is handled by mod_proxy. Mod_proxy wins out over Location matches. Perhaps you can modify gateone code to have one URL for the web interface and one for websockets (or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s already in place and we just need to know), but I don\u0026rsquo;t see a way at this time to get this working under Apache. I may be able to work with the gateone author and the mod_websocket_tcp_proxy.c author to come up with a solution. Or I could try installing nginx. In the meantime, I can continue to run Open Gate as a non-root user on a non-standard port. Alternatively, I could find a wrapper to bring port 443 to 2443.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/exploring-gateone-browser-ssh-terminal/","tags":null,"title":"Exploring GateOne Browser SSH terminal"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Tags: puppet selinux\nOnce I got a rough handle on setting up Puppet, I decided to get Puppet Dashboard working on my puppetmaster (a Centos 6 server) to have a sort of web interface to view puppet statuses. Since I already have the puppetlabs repositories setup from when I installed puppet, this was almost as simple as running \u0026ldquo;yum install puppet-dashboard\u0026rdquo;.\nYou then go to /usr/share/puppet-dashboard and follow the install guide to get the database working. Then you can run it locally using the \u0026ldquo;sudo -u puppet-dashboard ./script/server -e production\u0026rdquo; command or starting the service (service puppet-dashboard start). I recommed running it manually the first few times to make sure everything is working.\nAt this point, I was able to browse to http://puppetmaster:3000/ and view a nice looking dashboard with no hosts checked in. I then made sure to add the following to puppetmaster\u0026rsquo;s puppet.conf [master] section and restart puppet.\nreports = http, store reporturl = http://localhost:3000/reports/upload  I performed a \u0026ldquo;puppet agent \u0026ndash;test\u0026rdquo; on one of my puppets, and here is where I ran into trouble. Everything appeared to work, but no report or \u0026ldquo;pending task\u0026rdquo; showed up in the Dashboard. I ran the Dashboard locally so I could see the http request coming in. No request. I double checked my configuration, everything looked good.\nFinally, I ran my puppetmaster in debug/no-daemonize mode. (/usr/sbin/puppetmaster \u0026ndash;debug \u0026ndash;no-daemonize) so I could watch what was happening. However, in this mode, it worked fine. I ran /usr/sbin/puppetmaster without debugging and it still worked. The reports would get submitted to dashboard if I ran puppetmaster directly, but not if I started it with the init scripts.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any differences between how the init script was starting puppetmaster vs me starting it manually. However, I did come across this entry in /var/log/messages:\n Jul 25 10:15:16 puppetmasterj puppet-master[11988]: Compiled catalog for puppet2.lab in environment production in 1.16 seconds Jul 25 10:15:17 puppetmasterj puppet-master[11988]: Report processor failed: Permission denied - connect(2)  Which led me to the following entry in audit.log\n type=AVC msg=audit(1343225819.078:1582): avc: denied { name_connect } for pid=11988 comm=\"puppetmasterd\" dest=3000 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:puppetmaster_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:ntop_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket  This was an selinux issue. I quickly ascertained that turning enforcing off in selinux allowed my reports to get through. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anyone else online encountering this issue. However, many people disable selinux enforcing early on and I guess the cross-section of puppet-dashboard users and those using selinux enforcing is somewhat small.\nHow to fix this? There is a set of python programs called \u0026ldquo;audit2why\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;audit2allow\u0026rdquo; as part of the policycoreutils-python package. These tools will parse entries from the audit.log and either explain why an action was denied or provide a solution. You can get these tools by doing a \u0026ldquo;yum install policycoreutils-python\u0026rdquo;.\nNow we can use audit2allow to parse our audit.log error. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to run the tool, paste in your log entry, and then hit Ctrl+D on a blank line.\n [root@puppetmasterj tmp]# audit2allow -m puppetmaster type=AVC msg=audit(1343232143.497:1617): avc: denied { name_connect } for pid=12552 comm=\"puppetmasterd\" dest=3000 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:puppetmaster_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:ntop_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket module puppetmaster 1.0; require { type puppetmaster_t; type ntop_port_t; class tcp_socket name_connect; } #============= puppetmaster_t ============== allow puppetmaster_t ntop_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;  The above gives you a textual view of a module you can create to allow puppetmaster to make an outbound connection. audit2allow will even generate that module with the -M option.\n [root@puppetmasterj tmp]# audit2allow -M puppetmaster type=AVC msg=audit(1343232143.497:1617): avc: denied { name_connect } for pid=12552 comm=\"puppetmasterd\" dest=3000 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:puppetmaster_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:ntop_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket ******************** IMPORTANT *********************** To make this policy package active, execute: semodule -i puppetmaster.pp  That generated the module \u0026ldquo;puppetmaster.pp\u0026rdquo;. Despite the pp extension, this is not a puppet manifest, but an selinux binary module. Let\u0026rsquo;s install it.\n [root@puppetmasterj tmp]# semodule -i puppetmaster.pp  With that, puppetmaster can communicate with dashboard and reports are flowing. The only remaining thing left to do is to file a bug report. As it happened, someone had posted a bug report similar to this for documentation on the puppetdb project. I decided to append to that issue, but I suggested migrating the issue to the main puppet project. Issue #15567.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/puppet-dashboard-and-selinux/","tags":null,"title":"Puppet Dashboard and selinux"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is a basic walkthrough of getting a slightly complex \u0026ldquo;step by step to install\u0026rdquo; program like djbdns to install under puppet (in this case, under Ubuntu 12.04). It shows building the manifest, testing it, and some possible gotchas.\nI am generally following the guide put together by Higher Logic[1], with a few changes of my own.\nStep 1: Installation\nI use the dbndns fork of djbdns, which has a few patches installed that djbdns lacks. In fact, the djbdns package in Debian/Ubuntu is a virtual package that really install dbndns. To install it normally, you would type \u0026ldquo;sudo apt-get install dbndns\u0026rdquo;. This would also install daemontools and daemontools-run. However, we\u0026rsquo;ll also need make and ucspi-tcp. \nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to do this the puppet way. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming my puppet configuration in in /etc/puppet, node manifests are in /etc/puppet/nodes, and modules are in /etc/puppet/modules.\na. Create the dbndns module with a package definition to install\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/puppet/modules/dbndns/manifests\nsudo vi /etc/puppet/modules/dbndns/manifests/init.pp\nclass dbndns {\npackage {\ndbndns:\nensure =\u0026gt; present; \nucspi-tcp:\nensure =\u0026gt; present; \nmake:\nensure =\u0026gt; present;\n} \n}\nb.

But is it running? Well, djbdns uses daemontools, which runs svscan, and some searching online shows that in Ubuntu 12.04/Precise, this is now an upstart job. svscan is not running. So let\u0026rsquo;s make it run. Add the following to your init.pp (within the module definition):\ndefine the service to restart\n  service { \u0026ldquo;svscan\u0026rdquo;:\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;running\u0026rdquo;,\nprovider =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;upstart\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; Package[\u0026ldquo;dbndns\u0026rdquo;],\n} \nNow back on puppet2, let\u0026rsquo;s test it.\njohnh@puppet2:~# sudo puppet agent \u0026ndash;test\ninfo: Retrieving plugin\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/facter_dot_d.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/root_home.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/puppet_vardir.rb\ninfo: Caching catalog for puppet2.lab.example.net\ninfo: Applying configuration version \u0026lsquo;1340213237\u0026rsquo;\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/Service[svscan]/ensure: ensure changed \u0026lsquo;stopped\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;running\u0026rsquo;\nnotice: Finished catalog run in 0.47 seconds \nWe now told puppet to ensure that svscan is running.

Also, we make sure that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t attempt to start svscan unless dbndns is already installed.\nNow we have daemontools running, but we haven\u0026rsquo;t got it start our tinydns service yet. To do that, we need to create some users and configure the service.\nStep 2: Create users \nGoing back to our guide, our next step is to create users. We can do that in puppet as well.\n# Users for the chroot jail\nadduser \u0026ndash;no-create-home \u0026ndash;disabled-login \u0026ndash;shell /bin/false dnslog\nadduser \u0026ndash;no-create-home \u0026ndash;disabled-login \u0026ndash;shell /bin/false tinydns\nadduser \u0026ndash;no-create-home \u0026ndash;disabled-login \u0026ndash;shell /bin/false dnscache \nSo in our init.pp module file, we need to define our users:\nuser { \u0026ldquo;dnslog\u0026rdquo;:\nshell =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/bin/false\u0026rdquo;,\nmanagehome =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;,\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo;,\n}\nuser { \u0026ldquo;tinydns\u0026rdquo;:\nshell =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/bin/false\u0026rdquo;,\nmanagehome =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;,\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo;,\n}\nuser { \u0026ldquo;dnscache\u0026rdquo;:\nshell =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/bin/false\u0026rdquo;,\nmanagehome =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;,\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo;,\n} \nBack on puppet2, we can give that a test.\njohnh@puppet2:~$ sudo puppet agent \u0026ndash;test\ninfo: Retrieving plugin\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/facter_dot_d.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/root_home.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/puppet_vardir.rb\ninfo: Caching catalog for puppet2.lab.example.net\ninfo: Applying configuration version \u0026lsquo;1340215757\u0026rsquo;\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/User[dnscache]/ensure: created\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/User[tinydns]/ensure: created\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/User[dnslog]/ensure: created\nnotice: Finished catalog run in 0.86 seconds\njohnh@puppet2:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep dns\ndnscache:x:1001:1001::/home/dnscache:/bin/false\ntinydns:x:1002:1002::/home/tinydns:/bin/false\ndnslog:x:1003:1003::/home/dnslog:/bin/false \nSo far, so good. Now we have to do the configuration, which will require executing some commands.\nStep 3 - Configuration\nOur next step are the following commands: \nConfig\n  tinydns-conf tinydns dnslog /etc/tinydns/ 1.2.3.4\ndnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /etc/dnscache 127.0.0.1\ncd /etc/dnscache; touch /etc/dnscache/root/ip/127.0.0\nmkdir /etc/service ; cd /etc/service ; ln -sf /etc/tinydns/ ; ln -sf /etc/dnscache\nThe first two commands create our service directories. Authoratative tinydns is set to listen on 1.2.3.4 and dnscache is set to listen on 127.0.0.1. The 3rd command creates a file that restricts dnscache to only respond to requests from IPs starting with 127.0.0. This is isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary, but the challenge is interesting. \nWhat we want to do first is see if /etc/tinydns and /etc/dnscache exist and if not, run the -conf program. We also need to know the IP address. Fortunately, puppet provides this as a variable \u0026ldquo;$ipaddress\u0026rdquo;. Try running the \u0026ldquo;facter\u0026rdquo; command.\nPuppet has a property call creates that is ideal. If the directory specified by creates does not exist, it will perform the associated commands. Here are our new lines:\nexec { \u0026ldquo;configure-tinydns\u0026rdquo;:\ncommand =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/usr/bin/tinydns-conf tinydns dnslog /etc/tinydns $ipaddress\u0026rdquo;,\ncreates =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/etc/tinydns\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; Package[\u0026lsquo;dbndns\u0026rsquo;],\n} \nexec { \u0026ldquo;configure-dnscache\u0026rdquo;:\ncommand =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/usr/bin/dnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /etc/dnscache 127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo;,\ncreates =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/etc/dnscache\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; Package[\u0026lsquo;dbndns\u0026rsquo;],\n} \nThos will configure tinydns and dnscache, and then we can restrict dnscache\nfile { \u0026ldquo;/etc/dnscache/root/ip/127.0.0\u0026rdquo;:\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo;,\nowner =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;dnscache\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; Exec[\u0026ldquo;configure-dnscache\u0026rdquo;],\n} \nThen, we need to create the /etc/service directory and bring tinydns and dnscache under svscan\u0026rsquo;s control.\nfile { \u0026ldquo;/etc/service\u0026rdquo;:\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; Package[\u0026ldquo;dbndns\u0026rdquo;],\n} \nfile { \u0026ldquo;/etc/service/tinydns\u0026rdquo;:\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;link\u0026rdquo;,\ntarget =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/etc/tinydns\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; [ File[\u0026lsquo;/etc/service\u0026rsquo;], Exec[\u0026ldquo;configure-tinydns\u0026rdquo;], ],\n} \nfile { \u0026ldquo;/etc/service/dnscache\u0026rdquo;:\nensure =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;link\u0026rdquo;,\ntarget =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;/etc/dnscache\u0026rdquo;,\nrequire =\u0026gt; [ File[\u0026lsquo;/etc/service\u0026rsquo;], Exec[\u0026ldquo;configure-dnscache\u0026rdquo;] ],\n} \nAnd our tests:\njohnh@puppet2:~$ sudo puppet agent \u0026ndash;test\ninfo: Retrieving plugin\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/facter_dot_d.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/root_home.rb\ninfo: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/puppet_vardir.rb\ninfo: Caching catalog for puppet2.lab.example.net\ninfo: Applying configuration version \u0026lsquo;1340218775\u0026rsquo;\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/Exec[configure-dnscache]/returns: executed successfull\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/File[/etc/dnscache/root/ip/127.0.0]/ensure: created\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/File[/etc/service/dnscache]/ensure: created\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/Exec[configure-tinydns]/returns: executed successfully\nnotice: /Stage[main]/Dbndns/File[/etc/service/tinydns]/ensure: created\nnotice: Finished catalog run in 0.59 seconds\njohnh@puppet2:~$ ls /etc/service/tinydns/root/\nadd-alias add-alias6 add-childns add-host add-host6 add-mx add-ns data Makefile\njohnh@puppet2:~$ ps ax | grep supervise\n7932 ? S 0:00 supervise dnscache\n7933 ? S 0:00 supervise log\n7934 ? S 0:00 supervise tinydns\n7935 ? S 0:00 supervise log \nDoing a dig www.example.net @localhost returns 192.0.43.10, so dnscache works.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s check tinydns.

My wife has the same feature in her car and updates her thumb drive quite often with different music.\nWhen I was listening to Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game, I noticed that sometimes when I turned off the car, it would forget my place in the current file and start from the beginning. With Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game, the book was split up into lots of small MP3s, several per chapter, so this wasn\u0026rsquo;t too big a deal. I soon determined that the trick was to make sure the track was playing before I shut the car off. If I had it paused for some reason (say a phone call) when I shut the car off, the file would restart when I started the car back off. If I just turned off the car while it was playing, it would resume perfectly.\nHowever, after listening to the third book, \u0026ldquo;Xenocide\u0026rdquo; for around a week, somehow it went back to the beginning of the book. I did some fiddling with the and found I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find my place. After further examination, I discovered that this book is split into 3 MP3s, each over 6 hours long. My radio doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to forward within each track. Not many MP3 players do.\nI was able to resolve this by moving the book to my Android phone and setting up a Winamp playlist. Here, I can slide a little dot to any position in the file (and therefore the story) I want. I can also listen to the book outside of the car and keep my place. Rather nice.\nI am still bit annoyed about the need to do this. To me, this represented a huge shortcoming in audio books. After reflecting on this, I realised it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a shortcoming in audio books, but rather in the particular format and players involved.\nIn my last vehicle, I had listened to some audio books on mp3 on cd. Here, it was one huge mp3 for the entire book. However, the cd player always resumed at the same place. I knew that if I took the CD out, I would go back to the beginning though. This was another shortcoming. The CD player considered each MP3 a track and couldn\u0026rsquo;t fastforward within a track itself, only from track to track.\nSome of the original audio books were on tape. I suppose there might have been some on records, but the first format I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been familiar with was cassette tape. Tape players had no concept of tracks, everything was just a position on the tape. Ok, I know I had one tape player that would attempt to detect when one song ended and the other began, which would stop a fast forward when it reached a silent spot. But by and large, you navigated every second of the tape using fast forward and reverse. Tape was probably the best implementation of audio books.\nThen came audio books on CD. Most CD players I knew back then, along with some modern ones we have in our house now works track by track. Discmans, home theatre stereos and vehicle cd players almost universally have this limitation. I know a few players that can fast forward within a track, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t that big of a market for this feature, so it gets left out. Audio books on CD were a step backwards from tape.\nToday, we have audio books in a digital format such as mp3 or wav. These have a big advantage that they can be purchased online and downloaded. But unless you have a \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; player such as a computer, ipod touch or smartphone, you have the same limitation as a CD. Even the non-touch ipods have \u0026lsquo;track by track, file by file\u0026rsquo; controls.\nI suppose this problem will correct itself as tablets, smartphones, and all manner of personal computing devices proliferate. For now though, a decent audio book experience is limited to tape or \u0026ldquo;smart players\u0026rdquo;. There is a wide range of inexpensive (and expensive) mp3 players that will most likely end up frustrating anyone getting into audio books.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/audible-thoughts/","tags":null,"title":"Audible Thoughts"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Those of you that know me probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t guess this, but I actually work with a bunch of nerds, geeks, and freaks. Pretty much all of my coworkers have smartphones, and many of them have at least one tablet. Every time a new portable computing device launches, it\u0026rsquo;s a guarantee that someone in my group will show up with it. Since all these devices are nearly similar, no one is really impressed when a new one shows up in the office.\nA couple weeks ago, a friend of mine was studying for the GMAT test. With the GMAT materials is several sheets of laminated graph bound together. The idea is that you can practice on this with dry-erase markers while studying. I thought this was an ingenious idea. I had once tried to use a small whiteboard for temporary notes, but it lost its usefulness after a few notes. The graph paper \u0026ldquo;notebook\u0026rdquo; worked out to about 6 long sheets (3 pages front and back, legal sized), so you had plenty of room to take notes. I looked them up online, and one pad was running around $25. I tabled that idea.\nThis week, I remembered the pad and thought \u0026ldquo;I could just get some graph paper and laminate it myself!\u0026rdquo;. I stopped in a Big Lots and Dollar General. No graph paper. Then I went to target and found some. But while I was looking at that and trying to decide how I would bind it, I came across a 5-Star Flex Binder. The binder itself could be opened flat and came with dividers, graph paper, and regular lined paper for $10. I figured this would work out better than any homemade solution I would come up with.\nAnyways, I carried this thing fresh from the store into work. It caught everyone\u0026rsquo;s attention. In the parking lot, a coworker was like \u0026ldquo;look at you all impressive with your notebook\u0026rdquo;. I had it lying on my desk and everyone that passed it took notice. Where a $500 tablet gets a yawn, my $10 notebook was drawing a surprising amount of interest. I may have started something new.\nTo complete my story, I discovered that I did NOT have to laminate the graph paper. Three of the \u0026ldquo;divider pages had an insert for a full sheet of paper. I was able to place the graph paper into these plastic sheathes and they work great for dry erase markers.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nIt was a so I can definitely see why they are envious.

So my idea was to have monitoring server send the email alert to a local user, and have it piped through a program that would send the XMPP alert. In the future, perhaps an XMPP bot could also accept commands to control the monitoring system.\nI wanted to create a program called \u0026ldquo;jabblast.py\u0026rdquo; which would accept either standard input, or a command line argument, and send a message to a pre-defined list of recipients. \n echo \"sent from stdin\" | jabblast.py\njabblast.py -m \"sent from a command line argument\"  Looking at the python and XMPP options out there, I came across three that looked promising.  # xmpppy\n# sleekxmpp\n# twisted (the \"words\" extension)  I was really expecting to find exactly what I wanted to do already written. However, it seems anyone writing an XMPP script is creating a bot that runs continuously and would need modified for a one-time event.\nSleekxmpp was actually the easiest to understand and work with, however the project could be in danger of abandonment. Twisted looks the most advanced, and I am drawn to it because it seems to offer the most versatility. In my mind, I suspect that if I learn twisted for this, I can just keep using it for all the other stuff I want to do. However, it might be \u0026ldquo;too much\u0026rdquo; for this simple of an operation. xmpppy is the middle ground. The project seems relatively active and popular. \nThe problem with all three projects is a severe lack of documentation \u0026ndash; for twisted, this lack is primarily on the xmpp side. One thing very well hidden is how to specify the server name you want to connect to. Ideally, this is provided through a DNS record lookup, but that method eliminates experimentation with local network ip addresses. Sleek never even approaches the concept that you might want your XMPP program to end. It has a call for disconnecting, but when I call that, sleek immediately tries to reconnect.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and create my program using all three methods and decide later which I like best.\nFor these examples, I have hardcoded the login credentials, as well as the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; into the source code itself. In the real world, I should be pulling that from a configuration file, either XML or YAML (and potentially from a remote web page). Secondly, I only list one \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo;. I believe that going from sending a single message to sending multiple messages should be a matter of a for loop. Some libraries might even offer a feature to send to multiple recipients at once.\nFor my first example, I have created a script in sleekxmpp. I wrote this by looking at the EchoBot example found here. The script will send a message and then hang for a while after disconnecting before it finally exits. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why. If you enable logging, an error is thrown after you pass in the disconnect command. But otherwise, a relatively simple bit of code, easy to expand upon.\n #!/usr/bin/env python import sys\nimport logging\nimport sleekxmpp  # Uncomment the following line to turn on debugging\n#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=\"%(levelname)-8s %(message)s\")  def main() : # configure jabber id credentials and to\nto = 'recipient@example.net'\nmyjid = 'sender@example.net/blastbot'\nmysecret = 'password'  args = sys.argv[1:]\nif not args:\nmessage = sys.stdin.read()\nelse:\nmessage = sys.argv[1]  # print to, message\n# sys.exit()  bot = BlastBot(myjid, mysecret, to, message)\nbot.run()  class BlastBot : def __init__(self, jid, password, to, message) : self.message = message\nself.to = to\nself.xmpp = sleekxmpp.ClientXMPP(jid, password) self.xmpp.add_event_handler(\"session_start\", self.handleXMPPConnected)\nself.xmpp.add_event_handler(\"disconnected\", self.handleXMPPDisconnected)  def run(self) :\nself.xmpp.connect() self.xmpp.process(threaded=False)  def handleXMPPDisconnected(self, event) :\nsys.exit()  def handleXMPPConnected(self, event) :\nself.xmpp.sendMessage(self.to, self.message)\nself.xmpp.disconnect(self)  if __name__ == \"__main__\" :\nmain()  ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/jabbering-about-python/","tags":null,"title":"Jabbering about Python"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On one of my customer\u0026rsquo;s devices, the backup software requires that the backups go to a separate partition (or drive). However, the customer only has one raid array and the bulk of the space is in /home. To work around this limitation, I created a raw image file called backup.img, which gets mounted as /backup. After the software performs its local backup, I use duplicity to backup /backup remotely to a backup server at my location (with encryption).\nToday I got an alert that /backup was running low on space. It was an 80GB image and 61GB was in use, leaving only 15GB free. Now, this amount of free space should last quite a while. However, the software (cPanel) has a known issue for years that the 80% limit is hardcoded into the program. I can change this, but every time cPanel updates, it overwrites that change.\nSo to be proactive, I decided to go ahead and increase the image size.\nIn order to increase the size of an image, you simply unmount your raw image and use the dd command.\n # Increase by ~20GB\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=20480 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;

that call your functions, passing it input data and comparing it to an expected output. These unit tests will show what they received from your function and what they expected. If the two matched, you have succeeded. I like these practice samples mainly because it immediately forces you to apply the knowledge you learned. You do have to think about it and do some back and forth troubleshooting on your own code. Since they provided the unit tests, you can get instant feedback on if you\u0026rsquo;re doing it correctly or not.\nIf you want to learn Python and can dedicate an hour on any given day to it, I recommend the Google course. If you want to go in smaller 10-20 minute blocks, try using Learn Python The Hard Way. Of course, you can pause the videos and come back to them, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s much better to go through the entire video, following along on your own system as you go.

Domain servers in listed order: NS1.COBALT.COM\nNS2.COBALT.COM   So the cobaltnet.com domain is still in existance, at least until 2004. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve to anything. The reason for that is that the Cobalt.com domain name (notice ns1 and ns2.cobalt.com) itself has been purchased by another company, completely unrelated to the Cobalt server product. So this is interesting in that Sun not only let cobalt.com go, but they never bothered to update the cobaltnet.com domain to point to an active name server. Sun paid about $2 billion for the Cobalt name and now it sits in a neglected corner of the Internet, just a few months away from finally expiring.\nThis is one of many such example found on the net of things that vanish without a trace. Cobalt was one of the first companies to really produce a polished interface for managing a web server. Part of me wonders what would have happened if Cobalt/Sun had released that code as open source before the end came. Would the community have picked it up and developed something amazing with it, or would it have vanished like the parent company. Based on recent happenings with BeOSand Haiku, I suspect the former would have occurred.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/forgotten-realms/","tags":null,"title":"Forgotten Realms"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I have been out of the programming circuit for a few years and have been looking at getting back into it. My traditional programming style is an ssh window into my server and all my editing takes place on a development server, in vi.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to decent work out a way to determine how the world sees your connectivity from within your network. Essentially, I wanted to simulate accessing one of my locally connected machines from the Internet. Typically, you have to subscribe to a third party service to perform this service for you. Coincidentally, I have been reading up on Google App Engine and saw the potential in using GAE for my purpose. I could envision writing a monitoring system that runs entirely on the GAE. Unfortunately, I had no programming experience in Python or Java. I did see that PHP has been ported to Java and someone got PHP running on GAE. The possibility of either creating a new monitoring system in PHP (or modifying an existing PHP-based monitoring system) entered my mind.\nI decided that rather than stay with PHP, I would use this project as a method to learn Python. I started digging into Python resources and contemplating how I would want my monitoring system to work. Ultimately though, I decided I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to create a brand-new monitoring system (even a basic one) when existing ones such as Nagios and Zabbix do perfectly well. In my research, I found a project called mirrorrrthat used GAE as a web-proxy. This solution was immediately obvious. My existing monitoring system (Zabbix) has support for fetching web pages. I could place a file with the word \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; on my local web server and then fetch it through GAE. I could even determine through the returned page whether my server was down or if GAE was down.\nI set to work testing out the mirrorrr code under my own account. The major issue I observed is that mirrorrr is configured to cache pages, meaning that when I changed my OK to FAIL, mirrorrr never updated the page. In the closed-source world, that is the end of the story. However, since this is an open-source project, this was an opportunity.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to get back into programming, and I when I start back, I want to be familiar with using an IDE (namely Eclipse). In preparation for creating a monitoring system, I had setup a development station in (gasp) Windows Server 2003. I connect to this via remote desktop and generally leave Eclipse running 24x7. I had also gone through the steps of installing the PyDev plugin, the GAE plugins, and SVN plugins.\nThe Process\nI downloaded a copy of the code using SVN checkout and set to work editing the mirror.py file to disable CACHE. I call this the \u0026ldquo;dive in and learn to swim later\u0026rdquo; process. Here, I could make changes to existing code and test them out immediately. In fact, the SDK for GAE works as a sort of mini-server. Once I run the code within the SDK, any change I make to the source affects the running instance. I was able to read through and alter the code to allow me to switch between caching and non-caching. I ran into an issue with their \u0026ldquo;recent urls\u0026rdquo; feature. This shows the last 5 urls you have visited. When you are not caching your data, this never gets sets and starts throwing errors. I realized I would have to improve that section of the code before I could truly implement a configurable \u0026ldquo;enable cache\u0026rdquo; option.\nAt this point, I backed out of my file and considered my options. I wanted to make two distinct changes to the source, one of which requires the other. The author of the project hasn\u0026rsquo;t maid a change to his(her?) code since December of 2008. However, I did see recent entries in the Wiki, indicating this wasn\u0026rsquo;t an abandoned project. I realized that to truly make my changes worthwhile, I should try and get them included back in the upstream. To do so, I should submit each change separately. That required more tracking than I had been doing.\nSo, I took care of another todo list item. I went ahead and setup an \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; repository server for YourTech, checked out a fresh copy of mirrorrr, and then imported it into mine. Now I could work. I imported the project from my repo server into Eclipse and started recreating my work. First I added added a feature to disable the recent urls. At the same time, I made an improvement by moving a chunk of code into a self-contained method (which is apparently what python calls functions, as near I can tell at this juncture). Once this was committed, I went ahead and proceeded with recreating my work on disabling the cache.\nOnce I was done, you could enable or disable each feature separately. However, if you disabled the cache but left recent urls enabled, your recent urls would never update. On the flip side, if recent urls were recorded before disabling the cache, then you could see the most recent urls before caching was disabled. Some person may want that feature \u0026ndash; they could start up the mirrorrr, visit several links, then disable the cache, preserving those links on the main page forever.\nAt this point, the only remaining task was to submit my changes to the project maintainer. I opened issues 6 \u0026amp; 7 and now I await response.\nConclusion\nThe more I use Eclipse, the more I like it. The ability to perform every step of the process in one program is extremely useful. Steps like comparing history or checking out a specific version is much easier to grasp than when you are tooling around the command line. In the shell, I would typically have most of my files open as a background task. Reverting a file from subversion required switching back to the file, closing it, then reverting. In Eclipse, it\u0026rsquo;s a right-click operation, regardless of whether the file is open or not.\nPython\u0026rsquo;s syntax is a bit weird coming from a Perl and PHP background, but it\u0026rsquo;s learn-able. As I plan to make several more improvements to mirrorrr, I hope to become proficient in this language as well. However, I may be picking up a Perl project in the near future using the Mojo toolkit, so everything is up in the air.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/back-into-programming-monitoring-notes/","tags":null,"title":"Back into programming, monitoring notes"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Yes, it is my time.

For the downstairs, I\u0026rsquo;ve slated 6 windows for removal. Over the last few weekends I\u0026rsquo;ve been boarding them over on the outside \u0026ndash; not the typical \u0026ldquo;hurricane safety\u0026rdquo; boarding up, but precisely cutting the OSB to size and attaching it to the outside of the window frame. The outside is boraded up and now needs painted to match the exterior. My plans keep changing as I go along. On the inside, I have insulated and framed three of the windows. I\u0026rsquo;ve now permanently \u0026ldquo;en-framed\u0026rdquo; my air conditioner into the house (the air conditioner can be changed out if needed). I\u0026rsquo;ve worked out a nice way of covering the air conditioner in the winter without tape/plastic \u0026ndash; it involves paneling, specially threaded bolts set into the framing, Styrofoam, and wing-nuts. I\u0026rsquo;ve also worked out a way to setup some shelving in the window\u0026rsquo;s cavity. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been helping my parents re-arrange their entire house. Ideally, they will have a living room, a tv/kids room, and a family room. We\u0026rsquo;ve moved furniture, cleared out the \u0026ldquo;back room\u0026rdquo; (to make way for the family room), put down tile in the laundry room, and started the process of replacing the floor in the bathroom. The bathroom is a real treat. The underlying floor is concrete. Atop this, 1x1 ceramic tiles set in thin-crete \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s all good. Then, someone covered the 1x1 tiles with more thin-crete. Atop this, they glued down a carpet \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s not so good. Pulling the carpet up broke up the thin crete and the 1x1 tiles. So today I was out there with floor leveler and trowels creating a new, level floor for us to lay tile down onto. I knew this would take a long time and it did. Tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll be finishing up by laying tile and installing the new toilet. Dad is planning to start laying tile down in the morning around the toilet area \u0026ndash; maybe he\u0026rsquo;ll get into a groove and just keep going. :} Nah.. the toilet will probably take longer than the toilet as it is completely unassembled. Robin has finished up the semester today. Classes were canceled yesterday due to a minor ice maelstrom sweeping through the area, so her tests were stacked up for today. Not sure how things went, but assuming she passed, then she only has one more semester to complete before she graduates in May. If things work out, we should be able to celebrate in Tel Aviv on our way to Jerusalem. At least, that\u0026rsquo;s the goal. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to save up some vacation between now and then, and the trip will cost upwards of $5000, but assuming those goals are met and no major enemies attack from the North, we should be able to make the trip. This will be my first International flight under my own direction, and it will be Robin\u0026rsquo;s first flight anywhere. Why waste that on something passe\u0026rsquo; like Europe or Hawaii when we can go swimming in the Dead Sea?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/falling-forward/","tags":null,"title":"Falling Forward"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Just so this is remembered for all time:  Robin (via AIM):   i thought those boobs looked familiar! \n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/classic-robin-quote/","tags":null,"title":"Classic Robin Quote"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My next movie/game night is planned for October 20th, starting at 5pm, roughly.

Now, there is another option.Ã‚Â They have a \u0026ldquo;coffee station\u0026rdquo; here with hot chocolate, coffee, and tea bags. Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee, and if I drank nothing but hot chocolate all night, I would explode.Ã‚Â Tea.. I occasionally like a cup of tea.Ã‚Â But what I really like is iced tea.

The first time I tried 2 tea bags in a Styrofoam cup of water in the microwave for 4 minutes.Ã‚Â When I pulled it out, the microwave was awash in tea and there was less than an inch in the bottom of the cup.Ã‚Â However.. that inch was strong enough to do the trick.Ã‚Â The second time around, I only used half a cup of water and 2 minutes in the microwave. So here\u0026rsquo;s the recipe:\n 2 tea bags 3/4 cup of water (roughly estimated, 1.5 inches)  Put that in a coffee cup of some kind and nuke it for 1.5 - 2 minutes.Ã‚Â Put in 2-4 sugar/splenda packets as desired.Ã‚Â Stir.Ã‚Â Now, pour it into your water bottle, add ice and cold water to fill.Ã‚Â Shake and enjoy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/iced-tea/","tags":null,"title":"Iced Tea"},{"categories":null,"contents":"When I was a young kid, I was interested in electronics.Ã‚Â When I got into my early teens, I got into computers.Ã‚Â Before I could drive, I had an idea that I wanted to start a business dealing with computers.Ã‚Â I was so cool.. I thought I could write programs in QBASIC and sell them.Ã‚Â I never did that, but I did start my business.Ã‚Â First it was a sideline, and things were good.Ã‚Â Eventually, I felt confident in it and stepped out on my own.Ã‚Â I did ok, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t make a real success of it.Ã‚Â As the years dragged on, my money ran out and I was finding it hard for my business to survive, much less thrive.Ã‚Â A lot of this was my own doing.Ã‚Â I had some great plans on how to make things more profitable.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â One plan was to offer classes to people.Ã‚Â Work up a lesson plan, teach two classes a day of 10 people each.Ã‚Â Each person pays $65 for the class and you\u0026rsquo;ve got $1300 for the week (which was approximately $260 a day for 2 hours each day, assuming 1 hour classes).Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Another thing I needed and planned on doing was to aggressively market some form of managed service to some of the larger local businesses.Ã‚Â With just 2 or 3 sustainable contracts, the same number of big companies can keep a smaller company afloat, leaving room for expansion. I figured these things out a long time ago.Ã‚Â Yet I have accomplished neither.Ã‚Â Why?Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to that question in a bit. Around the beginning of the year, I began to desperately seek a solution that would ensure that the shop\u0026rsquo;s bills would be paid and I could still support my customers.Ã‚Â I did this out of a sense of responsibility.Ã‚Â I had some bills \u0026ndash; mostly advertising in nature \u0026ndash; that I was behind on and didn\u0026rsquo;t see any clear path of ever getting them paid properly.Ã‚Â I wrote about this before.Ã‚Â One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that I like being responsible and being able to have my bills paid.Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t really care about having a lot of money, but I despise being in debt.Ã‚Â I let it gnaw at me.Ã‚Â If I have to tell someone that I can\u0026rsquo;t give them the money I owe them, it depresses me.Ã‚Â It means I\u0026rsquo;m not responsible, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what happened.Ã‚Â I shirked my responsibility to make good on my word.Ã‚Â I could argue that one has to take risks in business, and spending money you don\u0026rsquo;t have on advertising for money you may get is a common risk, but I remain unconvinced.Ã‚Â I had decided to devote myself entirely to fixing my situation. After nearly 8 months of searching, I found the ideal contract position.Ã‚Â It consolidated hours into 3 or 4 nights each week, providing me with 4 or 5 days of availability each week.Ã‚Â The pay was more than adequate, and beyond all my expectations, provided me with opportunities to learn skills that could directly benefit my business.Ã‚Â It also gave me time to think. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m more relaxed and on track to repaying my debts, I\u0026rsquo;ve been reflecting on why I failed in business.Ã‚Â Why did I fail to accomplish something I\u0026rsquo;ve been desiring for over a decade?Ã‚Â Well the truth is that what I thought I wanted and what I really want are two different things.Ã‚Â See.. running a business comes with a lot of things I was never really interested in.Ã‚Â What I have learned that I really want is the freedom to run my own business. What does that mean?Ã‚Â It means I have a great set of skills and services to offer people.Ã‚Â I do a good job because I like doing what I do.Ã‚Â I would like to be able to offer my skills and services to people and take a sense of satisfaction in making something work. But.. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be bogged down with a constant struggle to bring in new customers, to perform work I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in doing, and to generally.. run a business.Ã‚Â I had the most fun with my business when it was something that I could pick and choose the jobs I wanted to pursue.Ã‚Â When it became my lifeline, I ended up working for the business and stopped enjoying it. I\u0026rsquo;ve never really been concerned with money (except where the lack of it creates debt, which I am concerned with), so making a profitable business has never been enough of a priority.Ã‚Â I dislike sounding and acting like a salesperson, so I\u0026rsquo;ve avoided \u0026ldquo;salemanish tendencies\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;ve always figured people would trust a true computer technician over a salesperson any day.Ã‚Â I was right, but apparently not right enough to generate income.Ã‚Â Sales and making money shouldn\u0026rsquo;t (and aren\u0026rsquo;t) the most important part of running a business, but they are among the top concerns of running a successful business.Ã‚Â Which means that I am not that concerned about actually running a successful business. I want the freedom to have and run a business.Ã‚Â I want to have a business where I enjoy the work I do.Ã‚Â I want to have a business that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require me to be a salesperson. Ã‚Â I want to have a business that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require me to take on work I don\u0026rsquo;t want just to make a profit. For me, that\u0026rsquo;s where I am right now.Ã‚Â I have a few customers I can support with the time available to me.Ã‚Â I get work referred to me \u0026ndash; no sales.Ã‚Â I can say no to a potential customer if I feel I won\u0026rsquo;t enjoy doing the work.Ã‚Â When I do take on work, I know I will do a good job at it and will put my best effort forward.Ã‚Â While I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that I can make a profit on each customer\u0026rsquo;s work, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry if my profit will pay my bills.Ã‚Â It took me a long time, a lot of false starts, and a lot of lost money to realize what I want, and know I know that have what I have always wanted. (Yes, there are other things I want in life that are more important: A closer relationship with God, a family some day, and my friends.Ã‚Â This post isn\u0026rsquo;t concerned directly with these things, but is influenced by them.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/what-i-have-always-wanted/","tags":null,"title":"What I Have Always Wanted"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A few weeks ago I came across a choice phrase that got me thinking. The phrase was \u0026ldquo;unable to get addicted\u0026rdquo;. You know, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been addicted to anything. I wondered if it was possible for a person to be unable to get addicted to something. Then I wondered if there was even a word for it. Google came up dry at first. After some creative searching, I discovered that the following are the \u0026ldquo;opposite of addiction\u0026rdquo;: desensitization, prayer and fasting, and recovery. Desensitization is a fascinating word. The most relevant definitions of Desensitization is \u0026ldquo;the elimination or reduction of natural or acquired reactivity or sensitivity to an external stimulus\u0026rdquo;. I never knew that. But as fascinating as that is, it (and it\u0026rsquo;s derivative \u0026ldquo;desensitized\u0026rdquo;) don\u0026rsquo;t quit match. A desensitized person doesn\u0026rsquo;t react to external stimuli, and therefore can not become addicted that stimuli. However, I feel like we\u0026rsquo;re still reaching here. I eventually tabled this line of thought, but tonight I ended up talking it over with a friend who likes to think about such things as well. We went into word origins, prefixes and suffixes. Addiction and diction are not related (diction being a choice of words or enunciation). There is no word that is the opposite of addiction. But do not fear, for our story does not end here. We have created a word. Condiction is the opposite of addiction. Condiction is the state of being not addicted.

In 2001Ã‚Â I bought a Sony MVC CD1000 Camera.Ã‚Â I had been working at Pennswoods for quite a while and I had no bills to speak of.Ã‚Â Money was no problem for me.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â I also started up my business, signing a 5-year lease on a commercial building.Ã‚Â The next month, 9/11 happened and I was told to prepare for deployment. In 2002 I bought a Kyocera QCP 6035 smart phone.Ã‚Â During this year I also took a trip to Washington state for vacation.Ã‚Â This was a good phone.Ã‚Â It sometimes froze on me when I opened the flip, but it generally worked really well. It allowed me to combine my palm pilot and cell phone in one device, and I was all for that. In 2003 I upgraded to a Kyocera 7135 smart phone.Ã‚Â This was my favorite phone of all time.Ã‚Â Palm OS, clam-shell design.Ã‚Â What's not to love?Ã‚Â Apparently it can no longer be activated in the US because it does not have a tracking GPS built into it.Ã‚Â I was deployed at the beginning of the year and left the 6035 with my parents.Ã‚Â When I returned, I read reviews on the 7135 and got it within a month of my return.Ã‚Â If I could have this phone now (activated of course), I would still think of it as the better phone even though it lacks bluetooth support.Ã‚Â I have not come across a phone that I felt I would enjoy more (inside or outside my price range). In 2004 I was flat broke and bought Ramen noodles.Ã‚Â This was between deployments, between jobs, and I had serious car troubles.Ã‚Â It was a dismal time for me.Ã‚Â I spent each evening at a different house, moving from couch to couch. In 2005 I purchased an HP dv1000 laptop.Ã‚Â I tricked it out with a whopping 512MB of ram, 80GB hard drive, and extended battery (lasts 3+ hours).Ã‚Â I should also point out that during the summer of 2005, I was again broke. My business was my sole source of income and not doing as much as I wanted it to. However, everyone else I knew was broke, and we all enjoyed that summer playing pool, eating at Dennys, and taking road trips to Western PA, Eastern Maryland, and Southern Virginia.Ã‚Â I don't know how we afforded any of it. In 2006 I purchased a house.Ã‚Â Not exactly a gadget, but I believe it will outlast all of my other gadgets.Ã‚Â Business was doing a lot better for me during this summer.Ã‚Â Up until winter came, things were truly looking up. This year, the year of 2007, I purchased a xv6700.Ã‚Â This is a Windows PPC 6700.Ã‚Â It comes with 64MB of ram, has bluetooth, wifi, is evdo capable, and will take mini-SD cards.Ã‚Â It has a touch screen and a slide out keyboard that works really well.Ã‚Â This device is more of a computer than a phone, and in that regard works very well.Ã‚Â The phone side of it leaves a bit to be desired.Ã‚Â There seems to be a slight delay between when you press a key and when it updates the screen, which is a bit distracting when placing a call or entering your pin.Ã‚Â Otherwise, this is an amazing gadget.Ã‚Â The phone portion is vastly improved if you use a bluetooth headset.Ã‚Â Plantronic Voyager 550 is the one I got and unlike those earpieces that you corkscrew into your ear, I barely notice that I'm wearing the headset.Ã‚Â I linked to a video review that I would highly recommend watching even if you're not in the market for such a phone/ppc.Ã‚Â There are reasons I chose a phone that is more of a computer than a phone, and I will go into that next.  As you may have read, I am working for \u0026ldquo;the man\u0026rdquo;, a big corporate entity in Virginia.Â My main business has become a sideline endeavor for the foreseeable future.Ã‚Â I still have customers I support, and I\u0026rsquo;ll still do a lot of the same stuff.Ã‚Â But, I\u0026rsquo;m not taking calls constantly for the business and not using my phone that much as a phone.Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;m shifting to work I can do remotely such as server administration, scripting, and device configuration.Ã‚Â Most of this can be done via web and email.Ã‚Â With an email/web/ssh capable mobile device, I can even handle some emergency tasks from just about anywhere. On another note, not splurge related, I have finally been placed on Night One.Ã‚Â This is a wonderful shift that is basically 3-4 (alternating) nights each week.Ã‚Â I will always work Sunday night, Monday Night, and Tuesday night.Ã‚Â Every other week, I will work Wendesday night as well.Ã‚Â The shifts go from 6pm till 6am.Ã‚Â Once I am done at either Tuesday or Wednesday morning, I am off to do my own thing until the following Sunday night.Ã‚Â The long shifts sound horrible, but I much prefer the shorter work week (even though I might go home to do even more work, of a different kind).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/splurge/","tags":null,"title":"Splurge"},{"categories":null,"contents":"So far, work down here has been pretty good.

Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been searching around, submitting resumes, getting calls and emails from recruiters.Ã‚Â Some really interesting positions have been offered to me.. a lot of them for places 4-6 hours away.Ã‚Â I had one recruiter contact me in March with a position for Lockheed Martin that was really interesting.Ã‚Â The interview process went fairly well and things seemed promising.Ã‚Â After my interview with Lockheed Martin, they let me know a week later that their project has had quite a few delays and they probably won\u0026rsquo;t be filling the position until July or even August \u0026ndash; however, they did feel I could handle the job and wanted to bring me on \u0026ndash; they just couldn\u0026rsquo;t right now. Then I stopped looking for a while because I started getting busy with the business.Ã‚Â Things started to peter out in June and I resumed the job hunt.Ã‚Â This time, I focused onÃ‚Â the more populated regions to the south of me.Ã‚Â I struck gold. I got an email from a recruiter in Bethesda, MD concerning a job in Sterling, VA.Ã‚Â It was for a web hosting company, administering Linux and Solaris servers, as well as customer support.Ã‚Â The opening was for night shift \u0026ndash; 3 to 4 nights each, giving me 36 to 48 hours and either a 3 or 4 day weekend. Before we could begin, I was giving an online exam to complete in order to test my Linux knowledge.Ã‚Â I felt that I had done horrible on this, but passed with a 3.7 (out of 4.0) scoring higher than 98% of all other test-takers.Ã‚Â This is quite encouraging. The next step was a trip to Bethesda to go over the position and my resume in detail.Ã‚Â My resume was then submitted to the hiring company and a phone screening was scheduled. The phone screening was a combination interview and rapid-fire verbal test by one of their Linux administrators.Ã‚Â This went fairly well and within a couple of days, I was scheduled for a \u0026ldquo;personal interview\u0026rdquo; along with another exam in Sterling.Ã‚Â This was on Wednesday. The exam consists of them breaking a server and giving you a series of administration/troubleshooting tasks to complete.Ã‚Â They allot up to 6 hours, most pass it in 2-3.Ã‚Â The fastest time on record was 45 minutes.Ã‚Â I completed it in 1 hour.Ã‚Â I was then asked if I wanted to try my hand at the Level III test. The Level III test was much more complicated and took me around 5 hours to complete.Ã‚Â But.. I did complete it to their satisfaction, even if some of my work was a bit \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo;. On Thursday I got a call that I needed to have one more interview with the IT Operations Director and we set this for Friday morning.Ã‚Â This interview was actually an interview where he basically tried to gauge my personality and determine if I was a good fit for the company.Ã‚Â He told me that he hadn\u0026rsquo;t discussed my test scores with any of my previous interviewers yet so he couldn\u0026rsquo;t make any decisions right then.Ã‚Â But he did say that \u0026ldquo;he liked me\u0026rdquo;.

I was hired \u0026ndash; it was official.Ã‚Â I had the second fastest time on record for the Level II, and had done fairly well on the Level III test. This placed me in a junior level Tier III position.Ã‚Â I can start Wednesday (the 27th). To top things off, I did find a room for rent in Sterling for an incredible price ($450/month) that is only 2 miles from where I\u0026rsquo;ll be working.Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I have this apartment yet \u0026ndash; I am going to call the guy again today to double check and then drive down this evening (he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get home till after 6pm).Ã‚Â As long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t a crack house or roach motel, I will go ahead and take it.Ã‚Â This way, I can bring my stuff down on Tuesday and spend the night for work on Wednesday.

Last evening, I drove to the house to pick up my purchase.Ã‚Â I pulled into the driveway and approached the house.Ã‚Â Little did I know, things were going to take an interesting turn.Ã‚Â As I walked towards the porch, three neighbors approached me and one asked me \u0026ldquo;what do you think you\u0026rsquo;re doing here?\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â When I told her I was here to meet someone, she told me \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t move\u0026rdquo; and she started calling someone on her phone. Apparently, rent has not been paid and the landlord has a) changed the locks, and b) told the neighbors (also his tenants) to call the cops if anyone came on the property and have them arrested for trespassing.Ã‚Â This was all revealed to me second hand as she talked to the Bedford police department.Ã‚Â During this phone call I considered my options. I very calmly produced a business card from my wallet and handed it to her.Ã‚Â I told her that obviously the person I was coming to see no longer lived here.Ã‚Â I told her that neither her, nor her landlord had any authority to keep me here, and I was leaving.Ã‚Â If the cops actually did bother coming, all of my information was on the card and they can come visit me at my home. Again I was told to stay \u0026ldquo;right where I was\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â She also kept saying that \u0026ldquo;she has to do what she was told.\u0026ldquo;Ã‚Â My response was that she had done what she was told \u0026ndash; someone arrived, she called the cops.Ã‚Â I then got into my Jeep and prepared to leave.Ã‚Â At this point, three of them went and stood in the bottom of the driveway, blocking my exit.Ã‚Â I backed up to within a foot of them.Ã‚Â The one boy said \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;ll have to drive right over me\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â During this time, they blocked the driveway with their vehicle. I had suspected it before, but know I was convinced.Ã‚Â These people were crazy.Ã‚Â They believed that they were obligated to be \u0026ldquo;enforcers\u0026rdquo; for their landlord, confronting random people (potentially violent people).Ã‚Â The lady told me that if she didn\u0026rsquo;t do this, she could \u0026ldquo;get in trouble\u0026rdquo;. I was considering the second option, which was to drive around the house and use the back entrance.Ã‚Â I wasn\u0026rsquo;t concerned about potential arrest \u0026ndash; pulling into an unmarked driveway to knock on a door is in my opinion, a non-offense.Ã‚Â I was concerned about waiting 40+ minutes for someone to arrive that could get them to move their car. Around this point, the phone rang and it was the landlord.Ã‚Â Apparently, she had tried to call him earlier.Ã‚Â She told him that I had arrived, the cops had been called, and that I was wanting to leave.Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the landlord said, but she immediately yelled at the driver to move the car out of the way and \u0026ldquo;to let him go\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â I then left. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the cops showed up or not, or what would have been said.Ã‚Â I have received no phone calls or visits.Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t actually consider myself a fugitive, but it makes for a great title. I was curious and looked up PA trespassing laws.Ã‚Â Generally, it is a misdemeanor, unless accompanied by a felonious act (vandalism). Each section starts off with \u0026ldquo; if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â Additionally (except for criminal trespasses), you have to receive communication to leave.Ã‚Â A defense for trespassing is: \u0026ldquo;the actor reasonably believed that the owner of the premises, or other person empowered to license access thereto, would have licensed him to enter or remain.\u0026rdquo; In my case, IÃ‚Â was invited by a tenant.Ã‚Â There were nothing posted against trespassing, and finally I was not asked to leave.Ã‚Â Rather, I was asked and then forced to remain. This is why I don\u0026rsquo;t like Tuesdays.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fugitive/","tags":null,"title":"Fugitive"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A few months ago, I was asked to be an usher at a wedding. For some reason, I decided \u0026ldquo;why not?\u0026rdquo;. I should have thought more about who was making the request. I actually do have varying degrees of dress clothes. I have my military dress uniforms. I have \u0026ldquo;business casual\u0026rdquo; clothes. I also recently purchased a formal suit to wear the last year\u0026rsquo;s Marine Corp Ball. However, none of these will work in this wedding\u0026rsquo;s bridal party. So, I got measured for the official tux outfit. A few days ago, I was told the news that the tux rental would be approximately $100. A one day rental of a piece of clothing is $100?!?. That\u0026rsquo;s about what my suit cost. I looked on nextag in disbelief. Most tuxedos range from cheap ($70), with most being around $140, and a few expensive ones actually ring in at $500. There is one tux by a brad name of \u0026ldquo;Collezioni\u0026rdquo; that runs $700. I figure that if a tux gets around 20 uses out of it in its lifespan (it should get a lot more, I would imagine), you can rent it at 1/10th the price and double your money. So, taking the most expensive tux I can find ($700 Collezioni), it would be $70. At 1/9th, it\u0026rsquo;s $77. At 1/8th, it\u0026rsquo;s $87.50. Finally, at 1/7th, it becomes $100. All of this is completely pointless though because I\u0026rsquo;m stuckg for \u0026ldquo;the privilege of wearing\u0026rdquo; some overpriced garments. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s another lesson learned (don\u0026rsquo;t get involved with people that are overly concerned about image and name brands) \u0026ndash; I just would prefer it if these lessons didn\u0026rsquo;t cost so much.

The premise is that people (presumably American, but I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert on this subject) will do karaoke performances on the show, judges will judge them, and then other people will vote for the contestant that they want to stay on the show. The last person standing gets the title of American Idol along with a record deal. Anyways.. as I said above, I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen a few episodes. I hate this show.

Back in \u0026lsquo;05/\u0026lsquo;06, I had this setup with Mepis Linux, dual-booting with Windows XP. Now the thing about this laptop is that it has a Broadcom wireless card (BCM43xx). With Mepis, I used ndsiwrapper to get the card working. However, the screen resolution was never very good, media files would play weird (codes at the time were a bit off, I think), and sometimes when switching wireless networks, the entire system would freeze. Wireless support was all command-line based (iwlist eht1 scanning) and didn\u0026rsquo;t support WPA encryption. Because of this and my highly mobile workstyle, I eventually switched back to Windows XP. A year has passed and I\u0026rsquo;ve been itching to get back to having a linux powered laptop again. My computer still had a \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo; partitioning scheme left over from various installs of linux/windows/data recovery/whatever. Plus, Windows was long overdue for a reinstall. It was time to try Linux again. First, I made a backup of my data partition to an external hard drive. The interesting thing I did as well was to use VMWare\u0026rsquo;s converter program to convert my Windows XP install to a VMWare machine, effectively backing up the entire OS into one small directory (or, more accurately, one 13GB file). I was able to run my laptop\u0026rsquo;s OS and applications on another computer before I even attempted a single installation. Very impressive. I decided to start with Sabayon Linux. I had tried this recently as a Live Dvd on a tower system and was truly impressed with the options available with it. Sabayon is gentoo based, and gentoo has always been on the \u0026ldquo;bleeding edge\u0026rdquo; with hardware support compared to other distributions. Sabayon also comes pre-installed with Beryl, the nicest windows manager I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on any OS yet. The way it works with the live DVD is that you boot up into a fully functional version of the operating system with all the bells and whistles. I played a few movie files without any lag. The wifi worked, it just couldn\u0026rsquo;t do WPA, but it was working. I read an article about having to install WPA_supplicant to get WPA to work. I tried this, but was unable to on the live dvd. Otherwise, I was satisfied and went to install. The install took around 3 hours, which was mind boggling to me. However, I was able to browse the Internet, chat online, and send email while the install was going on, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind. Once the installed system was running, it was a bit faster than the dvd version, but still seemed kind of slow. My laptop is 2.0ghz with 512MB of ram, so I was somewhat dissapointed. I was able to install VMWare player and access my Windows XP install off of the external hard drive (this was extremely slow, but manageable). I could even mount the vmdk file as a partition and copy files off of if. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take me too long to setup Firefox, Thunderbird, and gaim with my profiles from Windows XP. Btw, that is a sweet feature of those three programs (and similiar OSS cross-platform applications). The configuration, extensions, bookmarks, and everything is saved in \u0026ldquo;profile directories\u0026rdquo; that can be copied from computer to computer, operating system to operating system. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even loose my cookies while switching Operating Systems. Now for the bad news. I installed WPA_Supplicant. I read several hundred guides to getting WPA to work. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to my private WPA network. Half the time, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to the unencrypted network. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Then, while using the system, I noticed something. Beryl was crashing. At first, I could no longer minimize windows. Then, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t move them. My taskbar would dissapear. Usually, logging out, then logging back in would fix this. The first two times, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much about it. However, it soon became an annoying trend. The applications would work fine, but the window could no longer be resized, moved, or closed. If I tried it without Beryl, things would be fine. All things considered, I was getting fustrated with this distribution. Maybe I could have gotten the wireless working. Maybe, I could have found a patch with Beryl to get it stable. Maybe I could run without Beryl. But I wanted to use an installation that \u0026ldquo;just works\u0026rdquo;. Earlier, I had booted up with Kubuntu. Ubuntu variants are vey popular now. They\u0026rsquo;re based off of Debian (just like Mepis is), which has a wonderful package system. Kubuntu is just like Ubuntu, only with a KDE Window Manager instead.Ã‚Â Kubuntu had deteched my \u0026ldquo;QuickPlay\u0026rdquo; keys which have the play, fast forward, and volume controls on them.Ã‚Â Nothing else I had used had done that (even Windows requires you to install the HP QuickPlay drivers) \u0026ldquo;out of the box\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â I went into this knowing I would have to do a few extra steps to get the wireless working.Ã‚Â I was a bit apprehensive since Ubuntu uses entirely \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; components, which means you have to add your own codecs to play media files like MP3s. While in the livecd, I was again impressed.Ã‚Â It had the resolution working better than Sabayon did (I hae a widescreen laptop).Ã‚Â The sound worked, the buttons worked, things ran faster.Ã‚Â There was no Beryl, but I figured I would ignore this for now (just how stable is Beryl anyways?) and soldier on.Ã‚Â I read the the newer version of the kernel used the BCM43xx module instead of the ndiswrapper I had used so long ago.Ã‚Â There were sites and apps to setup Ubuntu with all the \u0026ldquo;non-free\u0026rdquo; essentials that I would want.Ã‚Â I began the install. Again, because it was a live CD, I was able to browse, chat, and email while installing.Ã‚Â This installation only took about an hour to do.Ã‚Â Once I was back up, I mounted my USB drive, copied my data over to my home partition, mounted the virtual machine file, and copied my mozilla/gaim profile directories over.Ã‚Â Within an hour, I was back up in business running \u0026ldquo;my\u0026rdquo; Firefox, Thunderbird, and Gaim.Ã‚Â I also use KeePass to keep track of my passwords, and this is also cross-platform compatible.Ã‚Â My advice to anyone thinking of switching operating systems: start using the cross-platform apps.Ã‚Â When it comes time to switch, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to take your customizations with you. I read more sites on getting the wireless part working.Ã‚Â I downloaded some files, got bcm43xx working.Ã‚Â I could now scan the wifi networks around me (from the console).Ã‚Â Eventually, I found \u0026ldquo;K Network Manager\u0026rdquo; which I must admit, is a wonderful little utility.Ã‚Â It puts one icon in your system tray.Ã‚Â If you click on it, it shows the wired and wireless networks available.Ã‚Â With wpa_supplicant installed, you can click on a wpa enabled network and it asks you for the key.Ã‚Â And it worked the first time.Ã‚Â I was impressed.Ã‚Â After a day\u0026rsquo;s labor, I was able to disconnect the network cable on my desk. After a few days, I started running into problems.Ã‚Â The network manager (or probably the underlying wpa_supplicant) would loose the connection to my AP.Ã‚Â Sometimes, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to connect to any access point, encrypted or not.Ã‚Â Sometimes, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t detect a single wireless network. Also, dual-monitor support was lacking.Ã‚Â I wen through the config screens to extend my desktop onto my second monitor (did that with both Kubuntu and Sabayon).Ã‚Â First, you have to restart X.Ã‚Â In Kubuntu, this option is disabled, and you end up restarting the computer (yes, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a nice kill command to do it, but I figured I\u0026rsquo;d go all the way).Ã‚Â Then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.Ã‚Â In Windows, you can just check \u0026ldquo;extend desktop onto this monitor\u0026rdquo; and hit Apply.Ã‚Â You might have to fiddle with the resolution afterwards, but Windows XP understands extended monitors. Xorg/KDE does not (who handles that part?). So, last night, I went ahead and switched back to Windows XP.Ã‚Â The reinstall took about an hour.Ã‚Â I have the Driver recovery cd, so I ran that and got all the drivers working in one go.Ã‚Â Today I went and installed SP2, followed by the AutoPatcher updates.Ã‚Â That took about three hours to get it back up to \u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â And\u0026hellip; everything works, just as it had before. So.. if I had gotten a PCMCIAA card with a better chipset (Intel/Prism) I would most likely have had a better wireless experience. I know it\u0026rsquo;s really Broadcom\u0026rsquo;s fault for not working with Linux. With a desktop, I can pretty much swap out hardware to suit and not care.Ã‚Â With a laptop though, anything I add decreases my battery life, puts a breakable object hanging out the side (wether PCMCIAA or USB), and adds one more thing to remember to grab.Ã‚Â I am more productive in Linux when everything works, but for my laptop and countless others, the \u0026ldquo;barely there\u0026rdquo; support makes me fight my computer more than work on it. Ã‚Â Recently, Dell has been asking their customers what they want, and over 100k people responded with \u0026ldquo;Linux compatible\u0026rdquo;.Ã‚Â If Dell puts out a Linux compatible notebook, then my next laptop will most likely come from them.Ã‚Â Until then, I\u0026rsquo;ll be running Windows XP.Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;ll end up setting up a computer to keep up with the Windows Vista clients I have to support, and I do have an in-shop Linux desktop.Ã‚Â But my personal desktop will be Windows XP for probably another year.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/kubuntu-sabayon-and-windows-xp/","tags":null,"title":"Kubuntu, Sabayon, and Windows XP"},{"categories":null,"contents":"At first, I started noticing that my phone would beep in the middle of the night.Ã‚Â Upon checking, there would be no missed call, no voice mail, no text message.. nothing on the screen to tell my why it beeped.Ã‚Â Recently, I realized that the phone would beep at 1:13am.Ã‚Â This was the great mystery that I typically didn\u0026rsquo;t think about until oh\u0026hellip; 1:13am.

I had to replace two runs of pipe (hot and cold) running about 13 feet each, with 7 elbows (and small sections) on each pipe. I had a few holes 6\u0026rdquo;x6\u0026rdquo; each cut into my wall to see the existing pipes. I left these pipes in place, and did not remove an entire section of wall to do this. I started from the top and pushed the pipe down until I could grab it from the first hole. I repeated this all the way down to the floor, where I had to wiggle the pipe around until I was able to bend it and shove it into the basement.\n10963 10966 This process, repeated twice (once for the cold, once for the hot) took me less than 20 minutes to do. Along the way, I eliminated the need for 14 elbows. Then on Saturday, I rented the crimper tool ($10/day; $150 to buy) and crimped the downstairs into place in about 5 minutes. I made a mistake here with the red pipe. I had pulled it down and then crimped the excess. This left me 2\u0026rdquo; too short up top. The blue pipe had no issues. I spent probably another 10 minutes struggling with the red pipe before giving up and buying an inline coupler for $2. I crimped that to a piece of scrap pipe and had Robin turn on the water. She reported some dripping downstairs at the valve, but up in the ceiling was dry. The dripping downstairs was actually in the metal, threaded, shut-off valves. A bit of cranking with the monkey wrench fixed one, the other seems to have a leak in the older, galvanized pipe. The leak is so small, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to worry about it (Randy\u0026rsquo;s suggestion: put a cup underneath and use it to water your plants). But I\u0026rsquo;d say it would have taken less than 10 minutes to crimp it down, turn on the water, and fix the leaks on the threaded pipe, if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been for my mistake on the red pipe.

I ran out of oil, so no heat or hot water, my car went on the fritz, Robin wrecked her car, and some new bills started coming my way. So first let me tell you about the car.Ã‚Â I had some bald tires due to a bad alignment, plus the steering was sloppy.Ã‚Â I put two new tires on the car (making all 4 new again), then got the axle bushings replaced in the front.Ã‚Â Once I got the car back from that, I took it back to the tire shop to get a 4-wheel alignment. With this last bit of work, the entire front end has been completely redone.Ã‚Â The axle bushings were the only part of the front end that had never been replaced.Ã‚Â I was feeling good about this car \u0026ndash; since 2002, this car has not broken down or stranded me once (with the exception of some bad/cheap tires I put on it back in November popping open on me \u0026ndash; my fault).Ã‚Â The next day, the car overheats in front of Wal-Mart and shuts off.Ã‚Â I get it off to the side of the road, refill the radiator, put in some sealant, and things run hot, but fine for the next couple weeks. Two weeks ago, the engine was a decent temperature, I\u0026rsquo;m driving down 26 and coolant starts spraying all over my hood \u0026ndash; I blew a top hose.Ã‚Â As it turns out, the head gasket is blown \u0026ndash; has been for months.Ã‚Â I had taken in to my mechanic many months ago complaining about the smoke in the morning.Ã‚Â He didn\u0026rsquo;t figure it out, but Clark\u0026rsquo;s Radiator knew right away that the head was dumping coolant into the exhaust system.Ã‚Â So while my car will run, only God knows for how long. So around this time, the temperature drops into the single digits, bringing the overall temperature of my house to 38F, and freezing the pipes going to my bathroom. Ã‚Â I put 10 gallons into the tank to warm up the house, thaw out the pipes, etc.Ã‚Â I discover that the pipes going up to my bathroom have not only frozen, but developed a leak. I, being the super inelligent plumber that I am, punch my way through the wall till I find the leak, cut off the offending piece and take it to Zimmerman\u0026rsquo;s for a replacement.Ã‚Â There I am told (in the nicest possible way they can) that I screwed myself over (it\u0026rsquo;s galvanized steel pipe) and will have to replace an 8 foot section of pipe, plus the two elbows piece I have. Finally, things did start to look up.Ã‚Â I got ahold of the guy who\u0026rsquo;s name is on the title of my Jeep and we agree to transfer the title next Saturday.Ã‚Â Chuck calls me to tell me where to get some coil springs for that same Jeep.Ã‚Â I discover that PEX tubing is the greatest thing to happen to plumbing since the pipe wrench.Ã‚Â So I begin my planning, researching and implementing phase. Along the way, my Dad lets me know that their oven has died and would like some help getting it fixed.Ã‚Â I checked it out on Friday and determined I did not have the stuff needed.Ã‚Â The wires inside the oven appear to be wrapped in asbestos, not plastic like my wire has.

While the job seeking process is now in full gear, I do have a few projects lined up for February.Ã‚Â First off, I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking back the tech support telephone from Greg and doing more work in the shop.Ã‚Â I still hope to keep Greg on standby for various reasons, but my days will focus on providing technical support to the multitude of customers. WhileÃ‚Â I won\u0026rsquo;t be doing installs for Skyweb, I will be planning to work on their towers over the next month.Ã‚Â We will be raising up a brand new tower, replacing an existing one, and then put in around 5 higher capacity backbone links.Ã‚Â As time permits, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some service calls and signal checks in the area.Ã‚Â However, I do have AJ fully trained to do the installs and some service checks, so as soon as he gets a vehicle with some actual cargo room, he\u0026rsquo;ll be set. Raystown work continues.Ã‚Â There will be people wanting installs there of course, but we also have some tower work coming up and work around the Marina. To round out the month, several clients have expressed interest in getting me to work on their website, and I have some programming work to hopefully finish up for myself.Ã‚Â So while I\u0026rsquo;ll be freeing up 3 days a week, I have a hunch that I\u0026rsquo;ll be filling that \u0026ldquo;void\u0026rdquo; rather quickly.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cold-snap/","tags":null,"title":"Cold snap"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I was going to call this \u0026ldquo;A Tale of Two H\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;, but then I realized that there is a lot more of H going on than I originally realized. Anyways, since people have asked, the job in Hershey is somewhat up in the air.Ã‚Â I got some feedback about it.Ã‚Â Essentially, three people left for other jobs during December.Ã‚Â I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many were full time and how many were part time, but I know they went and hired one full-time person.Ã‚Â They are going to train that person (3 weeks) and then wait a week to see if they need another part time person or not.Ã‚Â Which is basically saying \u0026ldquo;you might get the job, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to see if we get along with what we have.\u0026rdquo; In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking at some other jobs.Ã‚Â Finding a \u0026ldquo;part-time\u0026rdquo; job is actually pretty hard.Ã‚Â Plenty of jobs are available for full time, with good pay and benefits. Ã‚Â Some of these jobs look very promising and are well within my skill set.Ã‚Â However, none of them really match what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for quite yet.Ã‚Â However, I did find a wonderful job in Hagerstown.Ã‚Â This is a full time position.Ã‚Â However, unlike the Hershey job, the job description looks like something I can keep interested in for a long time.Ã‚Â The pay is also very good (it starts at a rate that I would expect to get after working at one company for 5+ years).Ã‚Â I applied last week, and spoke with their \u0026ldquo;recruiter\u0026rdquo; today.Ã‚Â They are reviewing the resumes and will be scheduling interviews early next week.Ã‚Â He let me know that my resume was definitely \u0026ldquo;in the loop\u0026rdquo;, so if I understand him correctly, I should have my interview next week sometime.Ã‚Â He also said that they need to fill the position soon (and they need more than one person in this position).Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;m a bit excited about that.. out of the other jobs I looked at, this is one I really feel I would enjoy working. If I get the Hagerstown job, I\u0026rsquo;ll end up closing my shop for a few months until I can resolve my schedule and get things back on track.Ã‚Â I\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to take care of my existing clients over the weekends, and if I get a 4-day work schedule (or, while I\u0026rsquo;m dreaming, a 3-day) I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to have another day for them.Ã‚Â Plus, I think I\u0026rsquo;d be ready to hire someone to work for me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/a-tale-of-h/","tags":null,"title":"A Tale of H"},{"categories":null,"contents":"For those of you that don\u0026rsquo;t know \u0026ndash; I live by myself. Now that winter truly seems to be here, I have only been heating the living room in my house (with a space heater). The living room has become my office, my bedroom, and my changing room. This one room stays between 65F and 70F while rest of the house seems to hold around 49F. Anyways, I came home tonight and went up to my living room/office to do some work on the computer. I\u0026rsquo;m designing a mysql database for a recurring/real-time ISP billing system that I am writing when my gaim pops up and this \u0026ldquo;ann\u0026rdquo; is messaging me. I am dumbfounded as to who it could be. She obviously knows me, but how do I know her? Slowly, it hits me. This is Minnesota Ann! Actually, I thought it was Missouri Ann (I get those M states confused all the time), but she soon set me straight. But let me tell you about Minnesota Ann. Ann is \u0026ldquo;my first\u0026rdquo;. By that, I mean she is the first person that I met online that I talked to more than once. I met her on IRCNet in either late \u0026lsquo;97 or early \u0026lsquo;98. She introduced me to Skeletor1/Mike and #cool_teens. She was the first girl I ever knew that had a bot. I\u0026rsquo;ve talked with Ann many more times over the years. Somewhere in \u0026lsquo;02, I stopped getting on IRC as much, but we still messaged each other through AIM and related networks, occasional emails. But I would say I haven\u0026rsquo;t truly heard from her in about 3-4 years. She had changed her screen name. But she found my site off of Mike\u0026rsquo;s new site (she talks regularly with Mike), read my blog, and sent me a message out of the blue. Talking to her again brought back many memories. I almost want to hop back on IRC again (even though neither of us are still on). Now let\u0026rsquo;s think about this. I first registered sqbnet.net with InterNIC in \u0026lsquo;98. My first post on here was in \u0026lsquo;99 telling people about my joining the USMC. There were more posts since then, but I ended up loosing them in \u0026lsquo;02 through my own fumbling. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the same screen name (squegie) since 1997. I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u0026ldquo;Squegie T. Sanest\u0026rdquo; for 10 years. I am ancient according to Internet time. Ann has has the same email address since \u0026lsquo;98. Mine has shifted around. I had squegie@sqbnet.net and still do since \u0026lsquo;01. I now use john@yourtech.us and probably will for the rest of my natural life. My snail mail address stayed the same from \u0026lsquo;01 to \u0026lsquo;06. My phone number has remained the same from \u0026lsquo;00 through now. With LNP, it will probably stay with me until the phone number structure changes. I find myself amazed at the number of things that have changed since I was 15, and the number of things that have stuck around. I invite anyone that\u0026rsquo;s known me for a long time, or even if you\u0026rsquo;ve just been reading this site for a while, or anyone really to post a comment on here for me to read. If we haven\u0026rsquo;t talked in a while, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you. Post a comment, send an IM, or even send me an email. If you\u0026rsquo;re really up to it, give me a phone call.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ghosts-of-the-past/","tags":null,"title":"Ghosts of the Past"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/vics-wedding/","tags":null,"title":"Vic\u0026#8217;s wedding"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/kristins-wedding/","tags":null,"title":"Kristin\u0026#8217;s wedding"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/vietnam-vet-christmas-party/","tags":null,"title":"Vietnam Vet Christmas party"},{"categories":null,"contents":"New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve 2006 has come and gone. My \u0026ldquo;party\u0026rdquo; if you can still call it that was a lot smaller than planned, but still an enjoyable evening. The end of December has given me a lot of of time to reflect on the past year or so, on where I am, and think about what I want to do next. Reflection: In April of \u0026lsquo;05, I got home from my second trip to Iraq. By May of \u0026lsquo;05, I had received my last active duty paycheck and was living entirely off of income from my business (not counting the reserve pay of $100-$200 per month \u0026ndash; most of that went right back into Marine activities). In December of \u0026lsquo;05, I had survived eight months of \u0026ldquo;on my own\u0026rdquo;, survived Christmas, and I met Robin. In March of \u0026lsquo;06, I took another step and separated from the active reserves. No longer would I be making the trip to Ebensburg once a month. Two months later, in May, I committed to purchasing a house for me and my business, finalizing the paperwork and closing costs in June. In August, my business acquired Access Lightspeed, a nationwide dial-up ISP. In November, I took Robin to the Marine Corp Ball, and in December, we had Christmas together (multiple times). Overall, an excellent 21 months for me. Where I Am: While the last 21 months looks good on the surface, it was not without its rough spots. You can be moving along real good for a month or two, and then all of a sudden, you have a couple weeks of crap that leaves you spending the next two (good) months trying to catch back up. As it is, I have no real source of income I can count on to meet the bills each month. I am not as good as some people believe me to be. There are some people I don\u0026rsquo;t think very highly of. While everyone has been known to fall on hard times, these are the people that do it chronically. You know the type. They always have a reason for it, a story even. Somehow, through a series of seemingly unavoidable circumstances, the person has run out of money, and quite likely they have no work to make more of it. They live in a constant state of crisis. Well, it seems I am well on my way to becoming one of these people. I go from seemingly having plenty of work to having no work for no apparent reason. When there is no work, there is no money coming in, so I can\u0026rsquo;t pay the bills that are due, were due, are now past due. Something always comes up at the same time like needing heating oil for the house, or tires for the car, or (currently) axle bushings for the car. And you start to realize that if you told someone a story in August or September about why you couldn\u0026rsquo;t pay your bill right now, and then you\u0026rsquo;re telling them another story in December, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing quite as well as it seems. I hate having to tell someone that while I did agree to pay this amount before, I can\u0026rsquo;t make good on that agreement. So what do I do? I screen my calls with caller id. There are two people that call me, and I know their numbers. I know from previous times that if I do answer and tell them that I can\u0026rsquo;t pay right now, they will ask when I can, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It might be in three days, it might be in three weeks. And then I do something, I make the money, I call them up and make a payment, and everyone is happy for another month or two. But until I do that, I\u0026rsquo;m one of those people, either screening their calls or telling stories. I will tolerate those kind of people, but I can\u0026rsquo;t stand being one \u0026ndash; even though I am. I remember once back at the unit, everyone was expected to throw $2 into a fund each month (it went towards various \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; things for the unit). I did have $2, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t have it on me in cash, so I borrowed from a friend. This prompted a conversation with another friend from Pittsburgh. I explained how I was essentially broke after I put gas in my car to go home (all in good cheer though) and she asked how that could be. I told her that self-employment doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay as much as one would think. She told me that she had two jobs to make ends meet. There was a hint of an accusation in that. The truth is that even though I am really good at cutting corners, budgeting to save money, and stopping myself from buying things I can\u0026rsquo;t afford, I\u0026rsquo;m not really financially responsible. If I was, I would be doing everything in my power to make sure that I had enough money to make good on my promises. If I want my promises (fiscal or otherwise) to mean something, I have to stand behind them and honor them. What I want to do next: Basically, I am going to do what it takes to get my bills paid. Overall, my debt is mostly from advertising and total less than $5000 ($416/month). Compared to a lot of people I know, that is a small debt, but a debt nonetheless. To take care of this, I am going to take an actual W2 job that will provide me with a steady income. I\u0026rsquo;m calling it a part-time job because it will only be 3 days a week, but in truth, it will total 36 hours. I can always add more hours/days on as I need them. All income from this job will go towards my debt and immediate living expenses. It will take away from running the business and being available to clients, but is a necessary step for me to get things back on track.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/after-the-champagne-runs-dry/","tags":null,"title":"After the champagne runs dry"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Several interesting things (to me at least) have occurred recently.Ã‚Â For the most part I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending my time doing wireless installs and network troubleshooting for Skyweb down in Berkeley Springs. Robin and her family has had a few rough spots recently.Ã‚Â Her Uncle Lonnie died on the 20th, we had the viewing on the 22nd and the funeral the next day.Ã‚Â The day after, she nailed a deer with her car, and then the day after that, her sister\u0026rsquo;s fiance\u0026rsquo;s great grandfather died.

My first stop was at Greg \u0026amp; Tricia\u0026rsquo;s house.Ã‚Â I apparently had arrived before it was time for anyone to arrive, but was able to entertain myself with a Rubik cube for several hours.Ã‚Â I never solved it of course \u0026ndash; except through the technique of moving the stickers around, I am pretty sure it\u0026rsquo;s impossible (anyone that claims otherwise is lying).Ã‚Â The next stop was at the Clarke\u0026rsquo;s.Ã‚Â They had finished up their gift exchange and meal time by then, but once again, I was faced with a daunting puzzle.Ã‚Â This time, it was a wood puzzle that you take apart and put back together.Ã‚Â I was able to get it apart, but in two hours I had made little progress in getting it back together.Ã‚Â I did get some interesting shapes made, but nothing quite matching the original.Ã‚Â A very puzzling day so far.Ã‚Â The third and final stop of the day was back at Robin\u0026rsquo;s for the Christmas dinner. Thursday was the next Christmas party in a series.Ã‚Â This one was my family\u0026rsquo;s Christmas, up at Lisa\u0026rsquo;s in E-town.Ã‚Â Robin went with me (of course) and we rode up with Mom \u0026amp; Dad, spending the night.Ã‚Â Somehow, Robin wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared away by the entire family showing up \u0026ndash; but they said they would try harder next time. Finally, as if 4 Christmas\u0026rsquo;s wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, on Saturday we went to the Carson\u0026rsquo;s Family Christmas up in Freedom, PA.Ã‚Â I was supposed to meet a lot of the Robin\u0026rsquo;s family on her Mom\u0026rsquo;s side, but no one else felt like showing up, so it was a pretty small gathering.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/end-of-the-year/","tags":null,"title":"End of the year"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Always avoid alliteration.

Speaking of history, my Aunt Dorothy turned 80 just a little bit ago. This is a fairly interesting to think about. From the mid 1920s to today, we went from a recovering country, to color photographs, to fax machines, to computers, to cell phones, to the Internet, and beyond. She has kids, grandkids, great-grandkids, and even great-great-grandkids. I have cousins that have grandkids, even great-grandkids. As you can imagine, this has turned into a family reunion. Our family is scattered out across the US, so it takes something big to get everyone together into the same state. Before this, I remember going to my sister\u0026rsquo;s wedding and having the family there, and before that was my Grandpa\u0026rsquo;s funeral. If I remember correctly, he lived to the ripe age of \u0026lsquo;97. As far as family gatherings before that, I was too young to remember. I recall visiting one or two of my Aunts, or one of them coming up to visit us. I\u0026rsquo;d say that our get togethers seem to have happen every 7-10 years. Some of these people I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen in 12 years, and because of their age, I might not see again. Actually, probably the next event to get all of us together would be my own wedding, assuming I were to have such a thing. ;} Later, I\u0026rsquo;ll gather up as many pictures as I can and put together an album, but I had some spare time in the middle of the night.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/history/","tags":null,"title":"History"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Things have been moving really fast recently.

Robin feels the same way (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if she has \u0026ldquo;an age to get married by\u0026rdquo; though).\nSpeaking of marriages, Kara (living in North Carolina) got married recently. I mainly disagree with her as to her motives for getting married, but I hope it works out for her. Another friend of mine is also getting married in April of next year and I\u0026rsquo;m invited.

It\u0026rsquo;s got a full living area upstairs \u0026ndash; 1 bedroom, 1 living room (that is large enough to split into another bedroom), full kitchen and bathroom. The first floor was a doctor\u0026rsquo;s office at one point and is setup perfectly for business. It also has a basement and an attic. There is off-street parking available, but to get to it, you need permission from the neighbor to use his driveway. This has scared off a lot of potential buyers and drove the price down.\nAnyways, I am pretty much unable to get any sort of reasonable loan due to self-employment and problems arising from being overseas, and while I paid off all my credits cards in \u0026lsquo;04, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any active accounts. So I made an offer where I would pay all of the closing, taxes, and up-front costs if the owner would do owner financing. I was originally told that the owner just wanted to get rid of the house and pay off some debt/project he had going on. So, I was a bit discouraged, but I kept praying about it and asked others to pray as well. About a month later, I got pre-approved for a loan and went down to talk to the agent about it. While talking with him, he called over to the owner, and we ended up going over to talk to him about it. At this point, he took me up on my offer where he did the owner financing. He even lowered the price. Isn\u0026rsquo;t God awesome?\nSo we worked out a verbal agreement, I came back two days later and wrote up a contract with the real estate agent, I put a deposit down, and the owner gave me the keys. I\u0026rsquo;m now almost completely moved in. I moved myself in, I have internet, electricity, telephone, and water setup. I still need to run a network cord down to the first floor and move over my \u0026ldquo;tech bench\u0026rdquo; area, my two \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; computers and the printer. Once that is complete, the business will be moved as well.

We were headed for Hoss\u0026rsquo; before picking up Robin, but the line was long so we went to Ed\u0026rsquo;s instead (Friday night fish fry). Usually, when a place has a fish fry, it\u0026rsquo;s all pretty much made up and ready to go. Chris and I ordered the fish fry, Jess ordered steak. It took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive \u0026ndash; Jess\u0026rsquo;s steak was a bit cold, and our fish was warm (showing us what had just gotten cooked). The fish was horrible\u0026hellip; slimy inside, falling apart\u0026hellip; never again. The waitress was real nice though and recognized the three of us from the last time they came down.\nAnyways, after that we picked up Robin and went to Comedy night.. John was, per custom, an hour late. He missed the first comedian entirely. The comedians were from Philly, and (although they didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal this until the very end of the show) a husband/wife team. The husband (Brian Shecky) revealed this at the end. He did this as part of a joke, but I am actually taking the joke out of this in order to maintain a certain PG-13 rating on this site.\nWe dropped Robin off after that (she had to work at 8am), went back to the shop and watched Kronk\u0026rsquo;s New Groove.. it was funny.. there was couple singing parts they probably could have done without. Some good lines. Kronk at one point had secretaries named Tina and Marge (always getting their names mixed up). As he was loosing everything (including the secretaries) he stood at the balcony and said \u0026ldquo;Do not cry for me Marge and Tina.\u0026rdquo; You might have to say it out loud to get it.\nNext morning I had a few customers picking up/dropping off/paying bills (nice as always). We played Monopoly and I seriously won that. I started off purchasing a couple railroads and one of the utility companies. Then they started purchasing real properties. I purchased the other utility off of Chris for $300 and then his very next roll, he landed on it and ended up paying me back $120. Then, I proceeded to roll the dice, advancing to community chest, chance, free parking, my own properties the rest of the game, as they kept landing on my stuff. They built houses, I skipped right past them. Finally I started getting property and they would land on that. It was completely ridiculous\u0026hellip; I owned like 6 spots and had about $3000, whereas they were just barely over a grand and owned everything else. Chris landed on that one utility company he sold me over 6 times, rolling high number every time.\nAt 5, I went and picked up Robin (her brother started working on replacing the brakes on her car the week before new years, and the whole thing is turning into the never-ending project.. an entirely different saga of ordering the wrong parts, shipment delays, improper tools, busting a line\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous) and some subs for everyone and returned to the shop. John had arrived with his new date Reanna and for some reason they had changed plans from playing Clue to watching a movie, so we watched Kiss the Girls (which was actually quite good). There\u0026rsquo;s a scene where one woman is in the hospital, systems shutting slowly shutting down and they don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Morgan Freeman (playing a forensics psychologist) asks to borrow the Physician\u0026rsquo;s Desk Reference and figures out what she was infected with. It reminded me of in the Princess Bride where the prince sniffs a glass of wine and goes \u0026ldquo;Iocane powder.. I\u0026rsquo;d stake my life on it. It\u0026rsquo;s a colorless, orderless, tasteless drug.\u0026rdquo; Everyone got a kick out of that.\nAfter the movie, we finally did play clue. That was definitely a blast, and with 6 of us, it took almost an hour. Then, it was off to Denny\u0026rsquo;s for snacks and fun. I took some pictures there, but my camera was doing its fuzzy thing again. Basically if you turn it on and the lens doesn\u0026rsquo;t come out on its own, they come out fuzzy.

After that, took Robin home and called it a night.\nAnd to wrap up the weekend, went to church Sunday, gave two guys a ride back to Bedford, then met back up with Chris and Jess, and we kidnapped Adam. I snuck up to him and grabbed him as Chris peeled up in the Impala, and then I went to open the back door, it was locked, so Chris had to unlock the door, then I opened it and threw Adam in. We went to Denny\u0026rsquo;s for breakfast, Chris and Jess went home after that, and Adam is here checking email/chatting online.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/190/","tags":null,"title":"190"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I think I\u0026rsquo;ve become addicted.

I rarely make them, because I make resolutions all the time. This year though, I decided to make one, but I\u0026rsquo;ve actually started it well before the end of the year. I want to remove those things in my life that seperate me from God (bad habits, ways of thinking, etc). One of the big things that God has laid on my heart in 2005 has been sexual purity. While I may be physically pure, my mind is far from it, and I intend to change that in the here and now. I\u0026rsquo;d also like committ more time to reading the Bible, studying God\u0026rsquo;s word. Beyond that, I am believing in making my business profitable in the first 3 months of this year. I want to have all of the bills paid and current (not just the important bills), with a surplus in the bank. These are currently my main goals for 2006.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s been hapenning since the 30th? I ended up going down to a bar in Hopewell after all. John and myself are in dispute about the name.

Originally, I had an invite to go visit April, and the bulk of my time was going to spent visiting her, with a visit to Kristin in the midst of it. Kristin herself warned me that she was pretty busy, but wanted me to visit. Then, April dropped off the face of the planet, and I had to change my plans to visit Kristin and stay until plans were made with April. No big deal. On the drive down, I get message from April with a new number. I call it, we talk, we discuss visiting her. Then I have to hang up because I\u0026rsquo;m about to do some complicated Maryland merging manuevers and I wanted to devote my full attention to it. I do this, I call her back.. busy signal. Later, I try again\u0026hellip; busy signal. Ok, I say, let her call me back when she is off the phone.\nI get to Kristin\u0026rsquo;s, Emma is asleep and Kristin is cleaning up her room. I sit, she cleans, we talk\u0026hellip; all is good. Emma wakes up, we play, we visit, Emma goes to sleep, we go to the movies, we come back, Kristin goes to sleep, I get on the phone. I get ahold of April \u0026ndash; her phone was off the hook all day. We discuss meeting up the next day in the afternoon (say around 3pm). I am to call her to get directions and confirm a time. Ok, good.\nKristin is out pretty much the entire day the next day (I was warned about this), but her Dad takes me to the auto parts store in search of a piece for my muffler. I guess I should mention that the muffler on my car, the one I paid \u0026gt; 500 USD to replace last year (and didn\u0026rsquo;t drive for 10 months) broke on the drive down and I had to tie it up. Well, I was unsuccessful in fixing my muffler, but I think this part has a lifetime warranty (Advanced Auto sells it with a lifetime warranty for $100). Anwyays, I get some good tv watching time in, and attempt to call April, but no answer on either phone.\nKristin returns, we socialize for a bit, and I return home. During all this time, April did not make one attempt to call me. I\u0026rsquo;m kinda ticked at her about that. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t fair to me, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fair to Kristin/Kristin\u0026rsquo;s family either \u0026ndash; playing hostess for two days to someone that originally was only planning to be there part of one. Ai yai yai!\nOk, currently I\u0026rsquo;m looking for plans for New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to get drunk, and I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to do \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; (role-playing) like some of my friends are either. I need to be able to take Robin, who already cancelled one plan on the premise that I already had plans for both of us (which I did at the time \u0026ndash; they fell through). There is a quote from Rugrats where Stu says \u0026ldquo;Because I\u0026rsquo;ve lost control of my life.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; I feel a bit like that after the last few days. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong\u0026hellip; a lot of good things have been happening, and only a few annoyances here and there, but some of those annoyances are affecting friends of mine (perhaps more than me, or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s all in my head), so\u0026hellip; yeah. If I can\u0026rsquo;t find suitable plans by tomorrow, the goal is to create my own plans and host a movie night.

I suppose we could do our own ball dropping ceremony though.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/186/","tags":null,"title":"186"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Another day of Xmas gone by. Yesterday I went over to visit the family for our Christmas and there were all told about 15 of us gathered for the eating of food, exchanging of gifts, and catching up of events.\nA few memories that stand out in my mind: The kids all in one room having their \"mini\" family reunion, all talking excitedly about what they got for Christmas, what they've been doing, and where they recently moved. Justin picking up Madeline and swinging her around, hugs exchanged... if I had a video camera, that would have been captured. Earlier Justin (of 9 years, I think) rushing into the house excitedly carrying a 6-pack of assorted alchoholic beverages. Everyone gathered around Manda with a various drinks in their hands as Lisa helped her with the syringe... I'll leave all of you guessing on that one. All the kids playing Chicken Limbo and Twister, Manda, Justin and Shawn playing Twister (Shawn won on account of Manda cheating).  I took several pictures with my phone, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have the cable yet to transfer them to my computer, and it costs some amount of money to email them to my computer (as well as a lot of button pushing, time waiting for them to transmit), so you will have to wait on those. I\u0026rsquo;m also attempting to gather the family\u0026rsquo;s collection of photos (multiple people, multiple cameras) and post them. During the course of the day, my phone\u0026rsquo;s battery died and I was out of contact with the world.\nWent to Robin\u0026rsquo;s house again and was there till just about 1am. I arrived home about 15 minutes later or so, feeling generally in a good, happy-go-lucky mood. And why not? This has been one of the most stress free Christmas seasons I\u0026rsquo;ve had since I was a kid, I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling good about the way my business has been picking up (even if I\u0026rsquo;m still a bit impatient and have spells of fustration), I just had two fun days with friends and family, things are going good. So, I arrive home and check my answering machine. A friend of mine is on there, has been trying to get ahold of me most of the night, and sounded close to tears. I suddenly feel like the worst person in the world. To make matters worse, it\u0026rsquo;s almost half past one in the morning, if I call her house, I wake up parents, her cell phone doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in the house\u0026hellip; what do I do? I im her, then I try her cell phone to no avail. I replay the message and feel even worse.\nSo the next morning I give her a call and talk. Apparently, things are not so bad as I had made them out to be. I played her message for her and she was a bit surprised \u0026ldquo;Oh my.. I sound like I\u0026rsquo;m going to cry!\u0026rdquo; she remarks, while laughing. So I feel a little bit better about that. It\u0026rsquo;s still true that if she had needed me, I would have been out of reach, but that\u0026rsquo;s life. No one can be available to everyone all of the time, and that includes random phone calls. All\u0026rsquo;s well that ends well. (Or course, that is not to say that the ends justify the means.)\nOn a side note, I should explain that other people use the term urbanite. My use of the word is pretty much my own definition \u0026ndash; it may overlap other definitions in some ways, but not truly match my viewpoint of an urbanite. Along these lines, Kristin did not like me referring to her as an urbanite. I pointed out that I really said that she \u0026ldquo;has urbanite tendencies\u0026rdquo;, which she did have to agree with. I guess I can concede that she has \u0026ldquo;rural\u0026rdquo; tendencies as well and is stuck somewhere in the middle. But I stick by what I wrote earlier, with one caveat. While it may seem like I\u0026rsquo;m labelling people, I think of it more as \u0026ldquo;attributing\u0026rdquo;. So if I attribute someone as a party-goer, I might also attribute them as a \u0026ldquo;4.0 gpa academic type\u0026rdquo; elsewhere.\nContinuing with my holdiay season, I\u0026rsquo;m heading down to Maryland for a few days tomorrow. Nothing really defined, but sometimes that works out better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/185/","tags":null,"title":"185"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s see.. to address an email sent to me, yes I am aware of the spam infection on the guestbook.

I\u0026rsquo;m just very lazy about it.\nOk, now for today\u0026rsquo;s events (journal like for now, but then I plan to get more rant-like later in the post.\n First off, went to Church this morning at 10am. It was decent service, but it was a bit sparse, which surprised me. I thought that the Christmas morning service was going to be fuller than usual, but I thought about and most families don't have a tradition built up of going to Church on Christmas morning, because it's not every year the the 25th of December falls on a Sunday. I'm sure some genius/looser out there has probably figured out a nifty formula to tell me just how often this actually happens (without giving it a moment's thought, I'd say 'every seven years, allowing for fudging with that leap year catastrophe', but I would be wrong). Next up, went to Greg's house to drop off their card, give Alanna (almost definately spelled wrong) a stuffed snake of interesting origins, and to see Samareh Akilah Morse, the newest edition to the Morse clan, born December 8th, 2005. I arrived in Bedford around 2:30pm to visit the Clarke's for their after-Christmas festivities, which basically involved a buffet style brunch and light conversation. There was a mini-crisis going on with one member of the family, but because of privacy and since it wasn't what they would classify as a \"big deal\", I will shy away from the specifics. Also, I would like to point out that veggie tales have some funny holiday music, even if you are 24 years old. I left there around 3:30 to go to Robin's house (second meeting with Robin, first visit to the house) for her family's xmas dinner. We had a good time and I definately feel quite comfortable with her and her family. I ended up staying till almost midnight having conversation and watching television stuff. We made some indefinate plans for later this week, once we all figure out just what it is we are doing anyways. I do have a prior commitment to visit some friends out. I was going to attempt to make it during the week instead of New Year's weekend. I don't want to make plans to go out to the bar scene this year. I'm pretty well done with the bar scene (now, if you're talking about playing pool, or getting a bite to eat at a bar, that's a different story. But going out to go out and drink is no longer fun for me).  Ok, so while I was composing this entry in my mind, I came up with a quasi-philosphical/psychological question for myself to answer \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m asking, so this is my way of working it out. Basically, the idea is that if something is immediately recognizable to you, very familiar, can it mean as much as something that you don\u0026rsquo;t recognize, but must learn to understand? That seems a bit vague, so here\u0026rsquo;s some examples.\n\u0026lt;\nul\u0026gt; I had the same wallet for about 8 years. The thing was beat up, falling apart, money placed inside it got wrinkled, it didn\u0026rsquo;t hold any of my cards properly, but I really liked it. I decided I would keep it until it became pretty much physically impossible to use it as a wallet anymore. I knew it inside and out, I put up with its problems, and it was a part of me. When I lost it recently, I searched high, I searched low. Even after admitting it lost forever, I still held out hope of finding it again, and eventually I did. However, when given a new, very nice wallet for xmas, I got rid of the old wallet. So while I thought I cared for the old wallet greatly, when something new presented itself, something I am still \u0026ldquo;adjusting too\u0026rdquo; in some ways, I moved on. This is a bad example because the fact that the new wallet was a gift made it much more special than something that I had purchased on the spur of the moment 8 years ago. I am used to a certain type of gloves \u0026ndash; leather work gloves/shells, and the occasional knitted inserts. I can pretty much interchange between many different sytles of these gloves, so long as they are instantly recognizable to me. You could say that I don\u0026rsquo;t have loyalty to a pair of gloves because I can just as easily move on to another pair that seem close enough. However, if someone were to buy me a pair of nice leather gloves, or some other style outside of what I\u0026rsquo;m used to, they would most likely just find their way to a box. This is a pretty good example, but not close enough. Joseph Grizone (hopefully spelled right) rights a series of books about a man named Joshua living in modern times. Essentially, it is Jesus come again as a simple carpenter, affecting small towns out in the middle of nowhere. In the first book (aptly entitled \u0026ldquo;Joshua\u0026rdquo;), Joshua gets hired by two different churches to make a statue. For the first Church, he makes a sculpture of Jesus washing Peter\u0026rsquo;s feet. For the second, he makes a sculpture of Peter standing in full power and authority. The pastors of each church arrive to pick up their statues, coincidentally arriving at the same time. The pastor for the first church, dressed in an expensive suit, immediately goes to the statue of Peter in full power and authority. The other pastor, dressed in a more casual attire, goes to the other statue. They each immediately recognized the message in each statue. They actually had gone to the wrong statue for their church. Joshua told them that if they paid the amount agreed upon for the statue he carved, and then wanted to switch statues, that was up to them. The pastors agreed and did so. A few weeks later, the pastors called each other up. Since their statue had very familiar message to them, it fit in too well in their respective church and conveyed nothing. So they switched the statues back and because the message of the statues weren\u0026rsquo;t quite as familiar, it had more power and presence in the mind of the congregation. This is a counterpoint to the last example. Additionally, I want to touch on two different type of people, one I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with instantly, the other I\u0026rsquo;m not. I\u0026rsquo;m talking of what I call \u0026ldquo;urbanites\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rural types\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying either one is better or worse than the other. I\u0026rsquo;m mostly familiar with the rural types. With rural types, you go in, they don\u0026rsquo;t apologize about the mess (unless they don\u0026rsquo;t know you), and you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice the mess. Your first couple times, you\u0026rsquo;re offered a drink, food, etc\u0026hellip; After that, you\u0026rsquo;re offered refreshments when you arrive, but you are more than welcome to the fridge. Mi Casa Es Su Casa. I something think of this as function over form. Urbanites are just as friendly, but the word \u0026ldquo;proprieties\u0026rdquo; comes into play more often. During the course of your visit, your well being and status will be checked on often, as well as your desire for refreshments. This is perhaps even more polite than the rural types who might only ask if you want something while they happen to be in the kichen area. Being accustomed to \u0026ldquo;rural types\u0026rdquo;, I feel out of place when someone who is not necessarily getting something for themselves asks if I want something from the other room. I can simply go fetch for myself and offer to grab something for them (goes back to Mi Casa Es Su Casa) while I\u0026rsquo;m at it. If I say \u0026ldquo;yes, I\u0026rsquo;d like a glass of water\u0026rdquo; and they get it for me, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re not getting anything for themselves, I feel a bit like a jerk, while they\u0026rsquo;re feeling that they\u0026rsquo;re being a good host(ess) to get this for me in their house. If I say \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, then I would feel ackward getting a drink 5 minutes later. Also, I know all this in my logical brain, but logic often squares off with emotions. Conversely, if an urbanite is visiting me, I offer free reign over my fridge, but I feel the need to act urbanite, lest they think me rude for not offering them something to drink an hour after the first question goes by. Because.. I also know that they\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable going into my fridge, looking through my drawers for a spoon, or peering into my cabinets.  Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that I don\u0026rsquo;t understand these \u0026ldquo;urbanites\u0026rdquo; that well, and might feel somewhat out of place among their dwellings. My sister Lisa married an urbanite and adopted the urbanite lifestyle. My friend Kristin comes from an urbanite family, and is fairly urbanite herself, but I have put her in \u0026lsquo;rural type\u0026rsquo; settings and she enjoys herself, making me think that she could potentially convert (but probably won\u0026rsquo;t, especially if she has no reason to). My other friend April is fairly urbanite to my eyes, but seems out of place in \u0026lsquo;rural type\u0026rsquo; environments. So (while I\u0026rsquo;m not thinking so much about Kristin or April when I ask this, they\u0026rsquo;re just examples), I wonder which type would be a better match for me? Immediately, the rural type is the most familiar, the easiest to start a relationship with, and would be the most straightforward. A relationship with an urbanite takes longer to get accustomed to, would have many ackward starts, and would require a great deal more work to get to the same level you would achieve with the familiar type. Which would mean more to me in the long run though? The answer is of course that it all depends on the individual and you can\u0026rsquo;t tell if a relationship is going to work based off a label that you made up. That is the plain and simple truth, but I definately enjoyed pondering the question, and I will ponder it still because my answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually directly answer the question.\n\u0026lt;\nul\u0026gt; ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/184/","tags":null,"title":"184"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hmm\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s new?

Furthermore, she\u0026rsquo;s single, in college (going for a nursing degree), and seems rather intelligent, has the many of the same ideas as I do concerning non-dating/going out (and while this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be mentioned like it\u0026rsquo;s a priority, she\u0026rsquo;s also pleasing to the eye).\nSo Robin (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s her name, try to keep up will you?) invited me out to their 11pm service on Saturday (which is yesterday for those of you reading this without a calendar), and that went pretty well.

I\u0026rsquo;ve had to shovel the parking lot three times so far. I\u0026rsquo;m not disliking that activity as much as previous years. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s a great excercise \u0026ndash; but I\u0026rsquo;m usually left standing outside in a t-shirt sweating profusely as the wind whips around me. People think I\u0026rsquo;m crazy, and they are right. Anyways, this year I traded my VW Fox for a Wizard snowblower. I had to put a new spark plug in it, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand how the choke worked on it. On lawn mowers, the choke is part of the throttle, and regulates the engine speed. I have to fully open the choke on this to get it going (some of the time), and then I must gradually lower it and close it. Until I got the hang of this, it kept shutting off on me every couple minutes \u0026ndash; very annoying.

I guess it\u0026rsquo;s all part of growing up. Let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip; the issue has become a non-issue, at least as far as I\u0026rsquo;m directly concerned, no one got injured, and with a flip of the switch, everything slides to the back burner, lowest setting.\nSo movie night was a decent success. The movies themselves were pretty bad choices. We had (in order): Extreme Days, Kung Fu Hustle, The Ring 2, and Anchorman. One movie that was there but didn\u0026rsquo;t get watched was Constantine. Extreme Days was split perfectly down the middle between those that liked it and those that hated it. Kung Fu Hustle was liked by all but one, and the other two were viewed as lost time. We did have one dissenter in the group who is never allowed back into the movie night crowd, but the rest of the gang had a smashing good time and much talk was brandied about as far as having the next one. It broke up around 2am, but with the inner core sticking around till 4am.\nOh, another person recently attempted to defame my character. A group of us went to Denny\u0026rsquo;s on Thursday. It was my twin, his girl, and two teeny boppers. This was my first actuall meeting of my twin bro\u0026rsquo;s girl and I took an instant dislike to her \u0026ndash; it must have shown because the next day, she told a group of my friends that I made innapropriate advances towards one of the teeny boppers. This kind of backfired because not only did my friends (2/3s of which weren\u0026rsquo;t there) defend my character vehemently, when the teeny bopper in question found out about it, she was just as surprised by the accusation as I was. I guess the guidelines of attempting to do the right thing, being honest about it when you didn\u0026rsquo;t, and practicing what you preach really goes a long way. People can make up any story that they want to and it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but I am glad to have friends that aren\u0026rsquo;t swayed by those that seek to cause dissent.\nOh and for any and all people travelling to Illinois this week, safe travels!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/174/","tags":null,"title":"174"},{"categories":null,"contents":"So let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip; a lot has happened, but little has been said. First off, moved the website to a different server, one that I have better confidence in (connectivity wise). I have not collected a drop of unemployment, not now, not ever. I am still living in a hole in the wall, still living on sandwiches, pasta, and handouts, but I am living and paying my bills. It has been over 6 months since my last paycheck of any kind (with no savings to speak of). I have been living entirely off of self-employment and that speaks volumes. So for all of you that has been putting up with my constant drone of not having enough money, thank you for being there for me and for bearing it. I am going to stop complaining, stop whining, and deal with it. If I go off track on this resolve, feel free to snap at me, yell at me, hit me, whatever. Remind me that I am where I am because of the choices I made, and I have had more than my share of good fortune fall my way. Of course, I really can\u0026rsquo;t take any credit, God put it all together for me, I just follow His lead.\nOk, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m evented out for right now. October 22nd was Scott\u0026rsquo;s wedding reception (no pictures), the 28th was a Halloween party in Altoona (still waiting on the pics), the 29th was a Halloween bash in Baltimore (ask for link), the 30th was Emma\u0026rsquo;s party (same statement). During that weekend, I met this chick named April who has reminded me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t even mentioned her on this site yet, but I have a song about her friend Kristin. That being said, the next weekend on the 5th, I celebrated my 230rd birthday (pics) with the aforementioned Kristin. Today is the actual b-day of that celebration.\nFriends April and Ali (both met at the Halloween bash) will be coming up tomorrow, and staying to movie night on the 13th. April is coming up to see me, and claims I don\u0026rsquo;t have to come up with activities to entertain her, but Ali on the other hand was somehow conned by April to drive her up here, and I am taking it upon myself to show these two a fun time in the wilds of PA. I will most likely fail, but exhaust myself in the effort (There is nothing to be raising eyebrows about!). Then, the 13th is of course, the great movie night.\nDo I get to rest after that? Hopefully. However, the 24th is Thanksgiving, and the 25th is comedy night, and who knows what might happen next? I need a vacation from myself.\nReferring back to a rant some time back, I quote \u0026ldquo;dating is a stupid way to get to know someone\u0026rdquo;. It turns out that is truer than I expected. Discussing this with a collection of people across the globe, I think that \u0026ldquo;courting\u0026rdquo; is the way to go. In courting, when you find the one that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, you do everything with them with a group of friends. You never truly know someone unless you know their friends, family, and how they all interact together. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to committ to someone, you\u0026rsquo;re committing to their life and them to yours, and that is bigger than two people. Some may read this and think I\u0026rsquo;m talking to/about them, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t aimed at anyone in particular. This is just something I am going to do when I get to that point.\nAlso, if I\u0026rsquo;ve ticked anyone off recently (yes, I\u0026rsquo;m talking to you), it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my intention to, so I apologize. I\u0026rsquo;m doing the best I can with my circumstances, and if that\u0026rsquo;s not good enough, then there\u0026rsquo;s not much I can do about that. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s something I can correct, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t tell me, I can only guess and speculate and come up with ideas that are probably wrong. Maybe I can\u0026rsquo;t correct it, maybe I might choose not to, but you\u0026rsquo;ll never know unless you talk to me about it.\nSome other people I know need to grow up and start making promises they can keep, face up to those that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t, and just deal with it.\nOk, now I must go with friends to visit their friends.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/172/","tags":null,"title":"172"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I kind of ranted in haste about something that was troubling me without really giving the other person a chance to talk to me.

I may have to take that unemployment I\u0026rsquo;ve held off on getting. On one hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to get the business going on its own steam, but right now it (and me) needs a serious infusion of cash \u0026ndash; all of the extra money has been going into building the cafe, and currently development in that direction has stalled completely. I guess that in reality, I\u0026rsquo;ve been paying into unemployment since I was 16, so taking some of that back in order to save my business isn\u0026rsquo;t so bad\u0026hellip; it still feels like a cop-out however.

I\u0026rsquo;m starting to wonder if there actually are any single Christian women near my age in the area. I am a single-white Christian male that practices abstinence, which puts me in a very small minority it seems. As I look around at women my age, I mostly come across one of the \u0026ldquo;nons\u0026rdquo;. Non-single, or non-Christian, or non-childless. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything against children, but I am waiting till marriage to have sex. My partner needs to have that same commitment, to understand and respect that. I have it on good authority and dating experience that a born-again virgin is even rarer than an actuall virgin. They may say that they\u0026rsquo;re going to wait this time, but the invitation is out there. So I\u0026rsquo;m a bit picky when it comes to women. I have this thing for smart, attractive Christian women that share some of my ideals.

I have now fully moved into the shop. Some people have a home-based business, well I have a business based home. I was looking back to nearly 3 years ago on rant number 28 about when I removed the computer from my house and talked about getting rid of my cell phone. Well, the opposite has occured. I have gotten rid of my cell phone, but have a computer practically anywhere I go. I'm going to try this out for the next 6 months or so, and I might not be getting one again.

The last time I got an official paycheck from anyone was April 29th. So if I'm not spending money on gas to come up and visit you, or going out to the movies, or stopping at the local burger joint as often as I used to, it's not because I don't want to.

I can have 11 emails revolving around one thread, and it only takes up on line in my inbox. Clicking on the message allows me to read all messages centered around that conversation. Mail clients have supported thread view for years, but this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it work in a predictable fashion. Very nice, and very conveinent. Thanks Google. Also, if anyone wants a gmail account, I have 5 invites to use up.

Things have been pretty slow at the cafe, but we have been bring some serious force to bear down on the insurgents of Fallujah. They\u0026rsquo;ve been retaliating with mortars out by my location, but so far they\u0026rsquo;ve done nothing more than stir up the fish. They were at it again before 5 this morning in fact. These people have no consideration for those that may be sleeping. I\u0026rsquo;ll guess we\u0026rsquo;ll just send some of the boys around to rough \u0026lsquo;em up a little. During the slow time, I went outside and fixed up some things around the place. Some of our camie netting was falling over, so I fixed that up in a more permanent fashion (driving stakes into a brick wall was interesting). After that, I was standing around with my hatchet looking for something to do, so I decided to go ahead and do something about the dilapidated cardboard box that has been serving as our bike\u0026rsquo;s basket for over a month now. So I went to our wood scrappile and busted apart an old pallet, pulled nails out, cut boards here and there with the hatchet or brute force (as the situation dictated), and began assembling a new basket. Before I got too far, I realized that I would only have enough useable wood for the base and 3 sides of a 4-sided box. So I thought about it a bit and made the 3-sided box\u0026hellip;. big enough to hold the cardboard box. So now, I have the wooden box bungee-corded to our bike somewhat (but not quite) permanetly, and the cardboard box can be taken in and out of the wooden box. One bonus I wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning on is the fact that the plywood on the wooden box sort naturally curls inwards, sort of gripping the cardboard box inside. Now, if only I can get Cpl. Obringer to draw a new flower on the front of this new, improved, bicycle basket (not available in stores)\u0026gt;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/148/","tags":null,"title":"148"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since my last update, so here goes. We have had all sorts of connectivity problems here. A crossover cable went bad (intermittenly bad), shutting down internet access. On the phone side, our modem went bad (slowly degrading over time), and then, we got hit by a virus on the computer side and segovia shut us off. These things happen I suppose, but when it all goes on within a weeks time, it tends to be very fustrating. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced the crossover cable, removed the defective modem (awaiting replacement), and re-partitioned/ghosted all of the computers to have very limited security policies and antivirus installed. Now, internet is back up and as soon as the modem gets here, we\u0026rsquo;ll have phones again.\nOn another note, I am actively recommending the mp3 player \u0026ldquo;billy\u0026rdquo; as a replacement for winamp on windows systems. It is very lightweight (less than 1mb in size), and can read in huge playlists of songs in a split second, and has an easy to learn interface. Basically, I was getting sick of how winamp bogs down when I put in a cd with over 600 songs in it. I tried ultraplayer with even worse results. Upon reading in the filelist from the cd, it crashes about 300 times with visualbasic errors. Media Player never likes mp3s with compressed idv3 tags, and has a bad enough time reading 622 songs as it is. But then, I found billy. Billy installs and runs as a green diamond in your taskbar. You open it up, choose the menu item \u0026ldquo;add folder\u0026rdquo; and select the cd drive and in a split second, your list is there. Then, I usually shuffle the list and hit play. No sweat. Granted this program doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the best playlist editor. Granted, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t read in idv3 tags, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to bother too many people. On another note, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too impressed with natty, the email checker. It may just be my system, but when I click on \u0026ldquo;add\u0026rdquo; it freezes and blinks on me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/147/","tags":null,"title":"147"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Well, I have finally fixed the photo album so that I may upload new pictures.

The last several times I\u0026rsquo;ve called her, I\u0026rsquo;ve always just missed her. The one time, she was at the fair, the next time she was working a 16-hour shift (and where she works, she\u0026rsquo;s not really allowed on the phone), the day after that I had just missed her leaving the house. However, I called at 1240am our time and got her as she was getting to the house. Well, the first time I missed her because my phone cut out, but the second time, I got her. It was very good to talk to her after all this time. She was doing good\u0026hellip; somewhat upset over a test that she had studied for and flunked. I feel bad for her because I know she works really hard at her studies. She\u0026rsquo;ll get a chance to retake it, but I think it kind of gave her some self-doubt. Anyways, her dad had apparently turned the oven on with a pan in it that had a plastic handle. She discovered this and pulled it out and ran water on it. When her dad came in, she told him about it in all seriousness, and I heard his reply \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a darn shame\u0026rdquo; in a not so serious tone. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty darn sure I like this guy, and I don\u0026rsquo;t even know him. I just like his laid-back reactions to things. She told me about the time that I knocked her into a fence at Hershey Park and he\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;good job\u0026rdquo;. Anyways, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to learn that Danielle doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about stone soup. This has shocked and amazed me. I asked if she had been home-schooled, and she asked if I was insulting her. So I asked if she thought home-schooling was worse than public school, and she said no, but thought I was saying that. Well it turns out that neither of us look down on home-schooling, and in fact, she isn\u0026rsquo;t home-schooled. So, I am in even more shock that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about stone soup. How could society fail her in this way? I gave her a mission to find out about stone soup. BTW, this whole stone soup fiasco (as it\u0026rsquo;s being called in popular media) came as a result of what we know how to cook, which came as a result of the pan in the oven. I had stated that I would never have that problem of turning the oven on with a plastic pan in it. Why? Because I don\u0026rsquo;t use an oven unless it has the word \u0026ldquo;microwave\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;toaster\u0026rdquo; in front of it. So, to make a long story longer, I somehow am now required to cook her a meal that isn\u0026rsquo;t a noodle when I get home. No problem. Popcorn\u0026rsquo;s a meal, right?

Distribution: This program is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php) CONFIGURATION: Go to the function post_echeck and change the $payto and $paytoid variables to match what you have with ChecksByNet. Alternatively, you could pass these in from the parent script. If ChecksByNet ever changes their submission url, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to change the $url variable. EXAMPLE: Note that in a production environment, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to pass $REQUEST in to the post_echeck function as the end user would be able to change the amount, payto, and paytoid at will. Ideally, you pull the cbn variables out of $REQUEST, do any regex checks you want to do on your side, and directly set the amount from the server side. post_echeck works by returning an array with the keys \u0026ldquo;approved\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;err\u0026rdquo;. $array[\u0026lsquo;approved\u0026rsquo;] // If set, echeck was approved. $array[\u0026lsquo;err\u0026rsquo;] // Human readable text of all errors. $array[\u0026lsquo;RSPxxxx\u0026rsquo;] // Server generated error as key, human readable error as value.

Thursday started off like any other day.. get up, go to work, leave work. The change came when I got close to home and I decided on a whim to try and call up an old friend of mine (by old, I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that she is older than me) and actually got ahold of her. We talked and caught up on news till I stopped in the local BPs for some Chester Fried Chicken\u0026hellip; the bomb* (*not affiliated with BPs or Chester Fried), where we talked some more before I could even order my chicken, and I got invited out to a biscuit and pepsi party, which got me mightily excited, as you can imagine. So of course, I go. Now, I should point out that my friend\u0026rsquo;s name is Alice, her sister (who is also a friend) is Sarah, and Sarah is dating a guy that shares my first name, so Alice occasionally uses that coincidence to play mischevious pranks upon Sarah. In any event, I arrive at the B\u0026amp;P party and we begin the movie watching event. By and by, in walks\u0026hellip; Sarah\u0026rsquo;s boyfriend, and we are introduced (this being the first time we have met). We eye each other up for a minute, and simultaneously he says \u0026ldquo;Hoagie!\u0026rdquo; as I exclaim \u0026ldquo;Griffith!\u0026rdquo; and we slap each other on the back. Alice and Sarah are wide-eyed with disbelief and disillusion. At this point, I should explain that I occasionally go by the nickname \u0026ldquo;Hoagie\u0026rdquo;, and this \u0026ldquo;Griffith\u0026rdquo; character is actually my twin brother, born in different cities, and\u0026hellip; to different parents. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen him in 4 years\u0026hellip; until now.

This was my first viewing of The Passion, (the first for all of us), so that was worthwhile. Again, the group (we\u0026rsquo;re forming a sort of scooby gang) remained together till about 2am before going our respective ways.

The total came to $179.12, which is slightly more than I\u0026rsquo;m used to paying (~$54). Intrigued I check out page 6 where I find two charges from ESBI which stands for Enhanced Services Billing Inc. They were billing on behalf of WebXites  and had two charges of 49.95 each, for a total of $99.90. On top of this was a federal tax of $3.00 along with a state tax of %5.99 which (for those of you that are too lazy to use a calculator) comes to $108.89. \u0026ldquo;Aha\u0026rdquo; you say \u0026ldquo;that explains everything.\u0026rdquo; Not quite. I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of esbi or webxites, and I have no clue why I am being charged a \u0026ldquo;webxites gold mo fee\u0026rdquo;. They provided the number 1-800-300-3724 for me to call, but surprisingly, they are closed. Also, on page 7 I have a charge from OAN billing on behalf of Nationwide Connect, Inc (which is also closed today) for $6.25 in \u0026ldquo;Direct dial charge\u0026rdquo;.\nSprint (my favorite local telco {think about that for a moment}) was open, and I did get these charges placed in dispute, meaning I don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay them for 60 days, which further means that I have that many days to get the charging companies to credit my bill.\nAlso, I have (or am supposed to have) a plan with sprint long distance for $0.06/minute but was actually getting charged $0.27/minute. This was actually easily resolved by calling sprint long distance up and making them see the errors of their ways. They had record of my original plan request (because I had record of it) and were able to issue credit for the price difference and switch my lines over the new plan. By this time, I had spent well over an hour with the various factions of Sprint. However, I had also been doing research on the internet and found that Nationwide Connect, Inc was basically a company that charges people for collect calls as soon as they answer the phone, and for the length of time you are on the phone (with silence playing on their end). This allows your answering machine to take the call for you. Brilliant. So, it\u0026rsquo;s back on the phone to Sprint to ask about anyway of blocking these 3rd party billing people. Well, there isn\u0026rsquo;t, at least not in my area. It seems it takes a state law in order to prevent from being charged for these \u0026ldquo;services\u0026rdquo;. I think that a telephone customer should have the option to prevent the local telco from billing them on behalf of 3rd party vendors. Basically, this affects local telephone service, and having over $100 in charges on your local telephone bill for things that have nothing to do with telephone service has the potential of being very damaging. Telco\u0026rsquo;s allow for blocking of 900# service, why not this third party billing? The only third party that should be allowed to bill me via my local telco should be my official long distance provider, which in this case is currently sprint long distance. Previously, it was MCI (which actually billed me seperately from my local telco). However, the difference is that your local telco KNOWS who your long distance provider is because they route your calls through them. Everyone else is most likely a slightly unscrupulous company, and I would rather not do business with them. If I want web hosting or site design, I would like my hosting provider/site designer bill me with a regular invoice, and I will pay it with a check or credit card. Just don\u0026rsquo;t mess with my telephone.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/126/","tags":null,"title":"126"},{"categories":null,"contents":"For anyone watching the news (as it relates to Iraq) recently, you may start to notice something. In previous months (ie, between August and now), you may have hear reports like \u0026ldquo;soldiers picked off by drive by shooters\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;car bomb kill 4 coalition forces.\u0026rdquo; Well, my guys (I\u0026rsquo;m talking Marines here), went back into country this last month. The headlines now read \u0026ldquo;Marines are engaged in heavy fighting across the region\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Marines get into firefight with rebels, destroy wall in the process.\u0026rdquo; If you recall, when we were there the first time, we beat the enemy into submission on our way to Baghdad, in a massive display of \u0026ldquo;shock and awe\u0026rdquo;. Then, we patrolled the streets as we waited for the other coalition forces to setup. When that was done, we showed them around and handed it over. Since then, things have fallen to pieces. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re going back in and we\u0026rsquo;re going to kick some serious ass. You\u0026rsquo;re going to see a lot more of Marine instigated battles over the next few weeks, and a lot less opposition. We may not stop a 5,000 year old blood feud, but we can put down an uprising. The bad side of this is that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing the Marine Corps being dragged into the role of being an occupational force, which isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be our job. We are a first-strike force for \u0026ldquo;when it absolutely, positively, has to be destroyed overnight.\u0026rdquo; In other news, closer to home, I\u0026rsquo;ve shut down my business in preparation for my upcoming deployment in about two months time. I\u0026rsquo;m done with spending every waking minute working on one thing or another. I\u0026rsquo;m going to relax between now and then, and I will have a good time. I\u0026rsquo;ve met a few new people recently, there\u0026rsquo;s Shelly who doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually live too far from me and is pretty darn cool to talk to. A lot of people I meet are dull and uninteresting. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Also interesting is starburst, the surfer girl from Florida. Andie is pretty cool, currently working 3 jobs. And there was Katie (aka \u0026ldquo;Kitten\u0026rdquo;), but she got dissapointed when she said that I \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t look like my picture\u0026rdquo; as she compared one picture of me to another picture of me. Apparently, in one picture, I appear to be a buff Asian guy. She was dissapointed that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really heard from her yet. Talking with other people, I discover I do have \u0026ldquo;an Asian thing\u0026rdquo; going on. So, I think that I should start telling people that I am, indeed, Asian, a refugee from the militaristic country of Myanmar and I could even go as far as making up a story about my journey to the us, how I joined the Marines so i could repay this country for the freedom it gave me. I could finish it up by creating an entire site devoted to my asian life, complete with those pics that portray me in an asian lite. Oh, and I am now the owner of an \u0026lsquo;88 VW Fox. Next week I will be getting the lasik done, so I will get rid of the glasses. All in the name of self-improvement. Sometime between now and deployment in June, I need to acquire a laptop at a very cheap price (800+mhz, dvd-rom, and at least a 10GB hard drive) that I will setup as a dual-boot between linux and winxp pro. I will then load it up with all sorts of developemt and server software, and in between high-pitched firefights, I will attempt to create some programs in Iraq.\nWell, that pretty much covers this update, I\u0026rsquo;m sure more will come (they always do).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/125/","tags":null,"title":"125"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Re: unresolved bugs?

Sending an email to gatecourier@sqbnet.net with the screen name as the first line of the message should cause gc to im that person.

Sorry, no go. Ok, fine. Now, I look on Nextel\u0026rsquo;s coverage map and notice they don\u0026rsquo;t really cover that much. They cover heavily populated areas and major highways. So what about their national plan? National on the nextel network. So what about roaming? There is no roaming on the national plan. What if I go off the nextel network?

There is nothing like places open 24 hours and last-minute panic to inspire holiday gift giving. I always shop at the last minute, not because I\u0026rsquo;m a procastinator (which I am), but because I generally don\u0026rsquo;t realize it\u0026rsquo;s the last minute till that minute is upon me.\nI hardly notice holidays at all\u0026hellip; most of them show up on the radar, I hear other people talk about them, and then they are past. It takes a big one like Thanksgiving or Christmas to grab my attention. And even an event like Christmas really only draws my interest because I suddenly am filled with a need to do some shopping. The thing about shopping is that I seldom go shopping. I have all of the clothes that I need, and I can pick up things like bread or lunch meat when I run low on one or the other. Lunch meat runs out quicker than nooodles, but when I ate nothing but pasta, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to get groceries but once every 3 months (I kept receipts to prove it to).\nSo shopping is a big deal for me\u0026hellip; it involves figuring out how much cash I can spend, what I want to get, and then I have to contemplate the places that will have what I want for the amount I want to spend. Once I arrive at the store, I must deal with the fact that, while I am not the only one shopping, I am certainly the least important and skilled. I have, through experience, found the best way to get through the shopping ordeal is to ignore the fact that other people exist and sweep through the store looking for that which I need. Once I find the item(s), I immediately proceed to the nearest checkout. I don\u0026rsquo;t go through the line, I simply rip out the upc code, and give this and some cash to the startled cashier and continue moving. Paying $20 for a $15 noisemaker is well worth avoiding any line.\nThe only disturbing thing this season was the fact that a friend of mine is acting all strange. A little background: this one lady I know invited me out for a Christmas play that she\u0026rsquo;ll be in. Her x-boyfriend, who is my friend, found out about this and started yelling at her about stealing his friends. As far as the relationship between myself and this lady go, we are nothing more than friends. In fact, we hardly know each other beyond talking on the phone and chatting online. However, my friend and the lady were a couple before my friend decided to play the field and started seeing another girl from another state, and then yet another while he was in Japan. He has also made no effort to seek forgiveness from the original lady, and has no ties to her. So now he has decided that he\u0026rsquo; jealous of the nothing that I have with the lady, and is generally angry with both of us, or will be if I go to see the play. And I am going, as I\u0026rsquo;ve already made plans to attend.\nOtherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s shaping up to be a good holiday.

Since the whole thing was in email, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make use of the pre tags again, bear with me if it messes things up.\nA rebuttal to the response to the rebuttal (BTW, this is going on sqbnet).\n\u0026gt; OK, let\u0026rsquo;s add it up another way.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 2001 Toyota Tacoma - around $15,000 total (taxes and everything). Six\n\u0026gt; thousand down, and the other $9K at 7.5% is still a payment of around \u0026gt; $180 a month.\n$6000 down. At my average of $500/running\u0026amp;inspected vehicle, that\u0026rsquo;s 12\nvehicles right there. I could run one/month with reasonable assurance.\n\u0026gt; I have a 3 year/30K mile unlimited warranty, plus a 7 year/70K warranty\n\u0026gt; on the powertrain. Toyotas have a good reputation for quality, so I\n\u0026gt; don\u0026rsquo;t see any reason why the truck won\u0026rsquo;t last me for 100K miles without\n\u0026gt; anything except regular maintenance. So, for roughly 7 years (~12K\n\u0026gt; miles a year), I will have spent exactly 2 hours shopping for and\n\u0026gt; purchasing a vehicle, and 0 hours of downtime due to unexpected vehicle\n\u0026gt; repairs, not to mention considerably less frustration. Plus, my shiny\n\u0026gt; (OK, OK, dirty) new truck is simply quite cool.\nToyota makes an exceptional vehicle, I don\u0026rsquo;t deny that. However, you\ncan\u0026rsquo;t honestly expect me to believe that in the next 2 years, you won\u0026rsquo;t\nrequire some sort of unexpected repairs. You may feel statistically\nsecure, but this is the real world, and nothing that states what side of\npercentage sign you\u0026rsquo;ll be on. Statistics are higher for older vehicles (or\nmore accurately, higher mileage vehicles, for example my 312,000+ mileage\nbuick skyhawk) to break down, but there is still a high number of older,\nhigh-mileage vehicles on the road today. Furthermore, in addition to\nengine/powertrain performance, all vehicles face the same potential of a\nblown tire, random patch of ice -\u0026gt; tree, and falling airplanes.\n\u0026gt; For those among us who choose the vehicles that are, shall we say, more\n\u0026gt; advanced in years, the tradeoff of a lesser average monthly payment is\n\u0026gt; offset by a variety of factors. First, the time lost to not having a\n\u0026gt; vehicle because it is in the shop. In my college days of driving cars\n\u0026gt; older than my siblings, I can count at least 2 work days plus 5 school\n\u0026gt; days lost due to lack of transportation. (No, there is no such thing as\n\u0026gt; bus service where I lived.) I am certain that those 5 days of lost\n\u0026gt; educational potential decreased my GPA significantly enough to cost me a\n\u0026gt; job making thousands of dollars more per year. OK, probably not, but\n\u0026gt; let\u0026rsquo;s just say so for the sake of argument. :) But the point remains,\n\u0026gt; while I never have a care in the world about my car breaking down\n\u0026gt; randomly (say, while going to the Marine Corps Ball?), and spare myself\n\u0026gt; the costs of Tylenol for the headache, or worse yet, a stress-related\n\u0026gt; personal breakdown requiring thousands of dollars of professional mental\n\u0026gt; help, others who choose the way of the old car are not so fortunate.\nThe impact of lost days depends on the situation and value you personally\nplace on them. For example, the Marine Corps is concerned more with\naccountability than punctuality. When asked, the platoon sgt can identify\nthe location of every marine under his/her charge. So, my breakdown was\ninsignificant on the face face of things.\nSecondly, if fustration from being stranded could lead you to headaches\nand possible personal breakdown, then you may already need professional\nmental help. Picture loosing your last 2 quarters to a vending machine,\ntraffic jams, breaking a key in the lock, vcr eating your tape, dropping\nyour monitor down a flight of stairs, and having paperwork blow out of\nyour hands. You can either take these as stress, or accept it as\nsomething that happens, one of the risks you take in life, and move on.\n\u0026gt; Time is money, is it not? So, let\u0026rsquo;s say you spend an average of 4 hours\n\u0026gt; (one afternoon) per vehicle purchase. Multiply that by what you make an\n\u0026gt; hour (more, I think, for me than for you, but it\u0026rsquo;ll still give you an\n\u0026gt; idea.) For me, that amount of time makes up the difference in car\n\u0026gt; payments for 1 month. So I am slowly carving away the difference.\nTime is money, time is money. That\u0026rsquo;s more of a philosophy than anything\nelse. There is an opportunity cost involved with anything, but not\nneccessarily a monetary value/cost. I could spend 4 hours valued at\n$25/hour (for non-math wizes reading this, that\u0026rsquo;s roughly $100) buying a\ncar or watching two movies every 8 or so months. BTW, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing\nthis for 5 years, and have had 5 different vehicles, most of which were\nunder $300, but with repairs and everything I\u0026rsquo;ve had under $2200 into\nthem. My 6th vehicle is the buick skyhawk which i\u0026rsquo;ve had somewhat under\n$1200 into. My Jeep I have had $500 into so far, and will be putting $500\nmore into it, which will bring my total to 7 vehicles, $4500. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t\nadded everything up in my last estimate, but this brings my overall\naverage to $75/month with no money down over $500. Keep in mind that for\nalmost two years of that time, I had two vehicles, and not just one. For\na good portion of this time, I would average at a minimum, 40 miles/day.\nFor one of those years, my bare minimum was 100 miles/day, more like\n150miles/day (college being 50 miles away, work being 20 miles away,\ncollege each weekday morning, work every day). Furthermore, one of these\nvehicles took me to Jacksonville, NC and back, 500 miles each way. To be\nfair, I didn\u0026rsquo;t attend college in the summer, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the full year.\n\u0026gt; At least with my insurance company, if I insure my car (which is\n\u0026gt; required by law in this state), I can\u0026rsquo;t later call and uninsure the car\n\u0026gt; so long as I still own it. My brand new truck cost LESS to insure than\n\u0026gt; my 8 year old Geo Storm (I will grant you, that Geo was considered a\n\u0026gt; sports car for insurance purposes\u0026hellip; sigh), and less than 20% more\n\u0026gt; than my 14 year old Mitsubishi Galant. I guarantee you, your insurance\n\u0026gt; on two older cars is more than my one new truck. Plus, you\u0026rsquo;re a male\n\u0026gt; under 25 years of age, which practically sentences you to bad insurance\n\u0026gt; rates. (It\u0026rsquo;s not much better for females anymore, so don\u0026rsquo;t take it too\n\u0026gt; personally.) And the more vehicles you own, the more insurance you have\n\u0026gt; to pay. This one\u0026rsquo;s pretty straightforward.\nHere is a situation that seems to have more to do with the state you live\nin (which is another topic of debate entirely) than the cost of owning a\ncar. In my state you are required to have insurance on your car in order\nto drive it. However, a parked car does not require insurance. However,\nif you move the car across the street without insurance, you risk a fine.\nMy insurance company actually will allow me to cancel service with them if\nI do not need it (I would be somewhat opposed to it otherwise). I can\ncancel and add vehicles individually of each other without cancelling the\nentire policy. I actually went through the added expense of maintaiing\ninsurance on two vehicles, instead of one at a time, mostly because I was\nplanning on using one for strictly business and one for strictly pleasure.\n\u0026gt; Second to last point, at your rate of acquiring 4 cars per year, well,\n\u0026gt; you\u0026rsquo;d need a place to store all those vehicles. Randomly selecting a\n\u0026gt; lot of one acre for your ever-increasing fleet of cars, trucks, vans,\n\u0026gt; jeeps, etc., at local prices, that would set you back around $40K.\n\u0026gt; Dividing that cost between the differ ence in price of your fleet and my\n\u0026gt; truck, amortized over the life of my loan and vehicle and your fleet,\n\u0026gt; that comes out to.. Well, I come out ahead in the end, because I said\n\u0026gt; so.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly why I don\u0026rsquo;t create such a fleet. However, in my particular\nsituation, I do have enough (wasted/unused) space to store upwards of\nvehicles, so I could potentially maintain a fleet of 20 vehicles. I can\u0026rsquo;t\nput that into the figure due to it being somewhat unique to my situation,\nbut enough people around here fall into the same category that it could be\ndone. Actually, undeveloped land (no house, no perk test, etc..) sells\nlocally for $9,000 or less. However, the potential remains to maintain a\ngroup of cars, keeping only the best of the lot, and selling off the\n\u0026ldquo;lesser of the lot\u0026rdquo; to either a junkyard or private buyer. You run the\nrisk of becoming a used car saleman, which is another reason I don\u0026rsquo;t\nmaintain a fleet at the cost of your truck. Remember $6000 down is 12\nvehicles, the remaining $9000 could almost purchase that acre of\nundeveloped ground (with a rate under 7%), and dividing the mileage\nbetween 12 vehicles will increase their life span exponentially, as well\nas thoroughly allowing you to eliminate downtime. If one vehicle is\nmaking a weird clicking noise, you can switch to another while having the\ntrouble car in the shop.\nYes, I know there are more costs involved with owning land than the $9000\nyou bought it with, and that model will end up being more expensive\ninitially than one vehicle bought for $15,000. However, you can own land\nforever and use the untapped space for other nefarious purposes (say, a\nstorage shed, or a quasi-house with no running water).\n\u0026gt; Finally, I had a really great last point to make, but I have forgotten\n\u0026gt; it by now. Thus, it must not have been that great. But fear not, I\n\u0026gt; will come through in the clutch and make the most overwhelmingly superb\n\u0026gt; point of the whole matter, clinching my victory in this debate -\nYou may want to make that point in short order, because you\u0026rsquo;ve so far\nproven that you\u0026rsquo;re laboring under a belief that your vehicle\u0026rsquo;s internals\nare invulnerable, the world ends when your vehicle stops, and the time\nlost searching for a vehicle is worth more than the time watching a movie\nor playing a computer game. Vehicle hunting can be just as fun, sort of\nlike a quest. Get a couple of friends along for the ride and turn it into\na group outing.\n\u0026gt; Only a damn good looking new truck like mine is worthy of driving over\n\u0026gt; the one and only world-famous speed bump.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; The End\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/56/","tags":null,"title":"56"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Got an email today from one of my friends. It\u0026rsquo;s a conversation I\u0026rsquo;ve had before with people, so I\u0026rsquo;ll state here again. Let me start with the email.\n You know, One could just buy a *new* vehicle, with a decent warranty, that would pretty much guarantee 7 years or 70K miles of worry-free driving, given regular maintenance. Just a thought. ;) Jenn P.S. Toyotas rock.  \nOk, sounds simple enough. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s look at some real numbers here. The cheapest 2003 Toyota Tacoma is blue booked at $12600. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I got one of these guys at exactly $12,600 AND let\u0026rsquo;s say I manage to get a 5-year loan at 4%. My cost and loan will definitely be higher, but I\u0026rsquo;ll play with these low numbers for fun. My monthly payment would be $232.05/month, every month, for 5 years. Almost every car I\u0026rsquo;ve ever bought has been $350, driven off the lot. With title transfer and everything, it\u0026rsquo;s still under $450. I then take that vehicle to the garage and put $100 into it. I\u0026rsquo;m up to $550. Let\u0026rsquo;s see.. that\u0026rsquo;s three months of my 5-year loan right there. This vehicle will last me about 8 months before I have to do anything else to it. 8 months where I\u0026rsquo;m saving $232.05 over the cost of a new car. At the end of this 8 months, let\u0026rsquo;s say I put $200 into it. That\u0026rsquo;s still less than one of my monthly payments.\nAs a case in point, my Buick (the most recent one to hit the dust) is the same one I bought in July of 2000. I paid $300 for it, and have put $700 into it over the last two years. Just recently, I had to replace the muffler, which when couple with yearly inspection cost me $140.00 (the car died 3 days later). That brings me up to just under $1200 for 28 months or just under $43/month. This is not an exception, but my typical spending. Now, the bigger question: Is it worth (at bare minimum) $189/month of saved money to be potentially stranded for a portion of a day? With a service like AAA plus, you get free towing at a mere cost of $60/year. This is something you should have independent of vehicle costs (it covers you even if you\u0026rsquo;re riding in someone elses vehicle). There is no such thing as worry-free driving. A new vehicle has less wear and tear on it, but can still fail you. The difference is that the warrantied vehicle will not require additional money out of your pocket (except of course, for your $232 monthly payment for the next 5 years) to get it fixed and running again. I could however, spend at a rate similiar to one of these loans and acquire 4 running, used vehicles per year, slowly building myself a fleet of cars and trucks.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/54/","tags":null,"title":"54"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s look at this. Real world scenario. My friend bought a 2001 (in 2001) Hyundai Tiburon bought for $15,500 and pays $367/month . Hyuandai has one of the best warranties on the market. About the same time that my Jeep broke down, his Tiburon lost first gear. His vehicle and my vehicle are in the shop getting repaired.

I start to suspect that the coincidence is too great for this to happen, and then start doubting my technical troubleshooting abilities. Tonight I was doing this on two computers I had replaced the motherboards on, a premio and a gateway. Suddenly, revelation dawned upon me. There are only so many hardware problems that happen to a computer, and while running a computer shop, I\u0026rsquo;m bound to come across the same problems, over and over again. When I have two systems at once, there is something like a 1 and 5 chance that they will have the same hardware problem! It sounds stupid, but this was such an amazing fact that I was nearly \u0026ldquo;bowled over\u0026rdquo; in delight. Every time I had diagnosed two computers with the same problem, I was worried that I was somehow overlooking something and taking an easy route. I kept thinking back to the analogy of using the wrong hammer for the right screw. After that realization, I also realized that most of my service calls had actually been hardware related and not necessarily software, which means that on the whole, people are fixing their own software problems (or otherwise ignoring them).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/49/","tags":null,"title":"49"},{"categories":null,"contents":"For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t already know, we had our Marine Core ball on the 9th up at the Ramada. This year, I took harlei, who is pictured elsewhere on this site under a different name. The day was doomed from the start.\nIt all started the Friday beforehand. I drove up to my parents\u0026rsquo; place where I keep my uniforms. I had (one month prior) placed my alpha\u0026rsquo;s into a uniform bag and driven it up to the center for tailoring, and presumably drove it back to my parents\u0026rsquo; place for safekeeping. To my dismay, the bag was not there. The bag was also not in my apartment, nor in my building, nor in any of the vehicles I may have been driving that day. This concerned me greatly because the uniform I was supposed to wear the following Saturday was in that bag.\nLuckily, I still had enough spare uniform peices to assemble one working uniform, with the exception of the alpha belt. I did not realize I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the alpha belt (which is in my uniform bag) till Saturday the next day. I got on the metaphorical horn and got someone to meet me up at the center. I took off in the jeep, met my contact, and checked my locker. No uniform bag. Luck was on my side however, as my contact allowed me to borrow his Alpha belt, which had no belt buckle. I remembered having a buckle at the apartment, so I took the belt, thanked the man, and left.\nBack in the hometown, I pulled into the barber shop parking lot to get my haircut, and observed that he was closed on this day of days. Not to be deterred, I jumped back into the jeep and drove into the next town over where a holiday hair was destined to be open, and indeed they were and they also charged me $14 for a haircut, which is over twice what I normally pay. Back in the jeep, back to home.\nAt home, I discover that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a belt buckle, and it\u0026rsquo;s getting close to the time I have to leave. I start making calls to fellow marines, and get nothing but answering machines. Sigh\u0026hellip; Once again, luck is on my side as I remember another stash of gear I had, and I found a belt buckle. Throwing my gear into the jeep, I take off to pick up my date.\nAs expected, my date was not ready, despite my being 20 minutes late. However, with great effort, we made it on the road 10 minutes later, stopped at a gas station, and took to the turnpike. Things were looking up.\nThe next disaster came after a quick drive down this nice toll-road. My jeep had decided to spring an additional leak, and my coolant had all leaked out, which meant I was now running hot. This is of course, unknown to me until the engine starts smoking. I let it cool down for 10 minutes, throw some more coolant in, and take off. I get a bit further down the road, and it overheats again, this time really bad. I stop, let it cool down for 20 minutes, when someone from the turnpike commission pulls in behind us. I try the jeep, it decides not to start. Bad sign.\nAfter talking to the turnpike guy, my plan is to get the jeep towed to the ramada inn, which is 19 miles from me. I can do something about the jeep from there. Unfortunately, it works out that the jeep gets towed back to bedford, to some garage. Yes, I did know they were going to do that, and yes, I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have let them, but I was primarily concerned with getting to the ball on time. Sometimes, I fail to think ahead, and I have to pay dearly for it.\nAnyways, the towtruck takes the vehicle, we ride with the turnpike guy to the hotel, and get there with about 10 minutes to spare, and I just make it to formation on time.\nNow that I have arrived, all of the bad stuff is now behind me, and I am free to partake in the open bar that was available, which I did, solidly, for the next 6 hours. Needless, to say, the ball was quite fun this year.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/47/","tags":null,"title":"47"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Another all nighter.

I celebrated by going up to this fair type thing that they were having in Martinsburg. Tickets were $1.75, which got you onto one (1) ride. You could purchase an all-day pass for $7, which pays for itself after 4 rides. I decided to take that route, even though I had only an hour to take these 4 rides and make my money back. As it turned out, the vendors were not even collecting tickets at this point, so I could have gotten away with purchasing just one ticket and waving it around like a trophy. Furthermore, I only managed to catch 2 rides, both of which involved spinning in a circle so fast that you were pressed against the wall. That is quite fun, seeing physics at work upon your own body.\nThe interesting thing about this whole 4th of July was how uninterested people seemed to be.

Surely in that city, they would be able to find a better place to hang out than the hospital. I don\u0026rsquo;t see what\u0026rsquo;s so fun about the place.

But there remains many questions about this case: Why were no fingerprints found on the alleged murder weapon? Who was the man seen running across 6th Street minutes after the assassination? Why is so much of the official report, including autopsy reports and photographs, still under seal a year after the crime?\nThe Citizens For Truth have vowed to get to the bottom of this case.\nPlease show your support by getting a ribbon from this site: http://www.geocities.com/dianawilm/\nHowever, even in the midst of this controversial assasination, there are some that claim he is still alive.

Furthermore, making iced tea is time consuming and the tea doesn\u0026rsquo;t last very long. The part I dislike the most is the quantity of trips I must make for beverages. My solution is to purchase a gallon of bottled water from the local grocery outlet. Since my intent is to drink from this bottle, I need something slightly unlike the traditional gallon jug. I settled upon a wonderfully designed jug of Deer Park Spring Water. It has a plastic handle on top and a wide mouth, allowing me to hold it near the mouth and drink greedily. Deer Park does not have a web site that I can find. The company that produces it is based out of Maryland. Their primary source is from Deer Park springs (what a coincidence, what with the name being Deer Park Spring Water). Interestingly enough, the town of Deer Park, MD is undergoing a water shortage. I was able to find out some good details about my water. For instance, Deer Park Spring Water is part of the Perrier Group which is owned by Nestle, SA the Swedish chocalate manufacturer.\nNestle has found a way to appear to be improving living conditions in under-developed nations while forming a small monopoly in the same. This has attracted little attention because most people are too busy boycotting Nestle for their Baby Food. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe what you here, they are not working with IBFAN Africa.
