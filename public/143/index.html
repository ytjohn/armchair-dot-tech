  <p>I finally got to get ahold of Danielle last night. The last several times I&rsquo;ve called her, I&rsquo;ve always just missed her.  The one time, she was at the fair, the next time she was working a 16-hour shift (and where she works, she&rsquo;s not really allowed on the phone), the day after that I had just missed her leaving the house.  However, I called at 1240am our time and got her as she was getting to the house.  Well, the first time I missed her because my phone cut out, but the second time, I got her.  It was very good to talk to her after all this time.  She was doing good&hellip; somewhat upset over a test that she had studied for and flunked.  I feel bad for her because I know she works really hard at her studies.  She&rsquo;ll get a chance to retake it, but I think it kind of gave her some self-doubt.  Anyways, her dad had apparently turned the oven on with a pan in it that had a plastic handle.  She discovered this and pulled it out and ran water on it.  When her dad came in, she told him about it in all seriousness, and I heard his reply &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a darn shame&rdquo; in a not so serious tone.  I&rsquo;m pretty darn sure I like this guy, and I don&rsquo;t even know him.  I just like his laid-back reactions to things.  She told me about the time that I knocked her into a fence at Hershey Park and he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;good job&rdquo;.  Anyways, I&rsquo;ve come to learn that Danielle doesn&rsquo;t know about <a href="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/stone_soup.html">stone soup</a>.  This has shocked and amazed me.  I asked if she had been home-schooled, and she asked if I was insulting her.  So I asked if she thought home-schooling was worse than public school, and she said no, but thought I was saying that.  Well it turns out that neither of us look down on home-schooling, and in fact, she isn&rsquo;t home-schooled.  So, I am in even more shock that she doesn&rsquo;t know about stone soup.  How could society fail her in this way?  I gave her a mission to find out about stone soup.  BTW, this whole stone soup fiasco (as it&rsquo;s being called in popular media) came as a result of what we know how to cook, which came as a result of the pan in the oven. I had stated that I would never have that problem of turning the oven on with a plastic pan in it.  Why?  Because I don&rsquo;t use an oven unless it has the word &ldquo;microwave&rdquo; or &ldquo;toaster&rdquo; in front of it.  So, to make a long story longer, I somehow am now required to cook her a meal that isn&rsquo;t a noodle when I get home.  No problem.  Popcorn&rsquo;s a meal, right?
<br /><br />
Cheers!</p>
