        I got myself a GMRS license 2 years ago. They are $80 for 5 years, and they allow an entire &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; family to use it. That&rsquo;s spouse, children, parents, in-laws. I thought I was going to put play around with some GMRS repeater/text data modes, never did.
Flash forward to more recent. Picked up a 4-pack of Baofeng BF-888S radios. These go for about $13 apiece and $42 for a 4-pack.

        Serial port console This is how to get serial port console working on a Ubuntu 16.04 (or any systemd based OS) and how to access it with idrac/ssh.
To get serial port working on a running system:
systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS0.service systemctl start serial-getty@ttyS0.service  Update Grub:
To get serial console during boot up, including the grub menu:
Go ahead and edit /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&amp;quot;splash quiet&amp;quot; GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&amp;quot;console=tty0&amp;quot; GRUB_TERMINAL=&amp;quot;console serial&amp;quot; # also, it takes so long to boot a server, adding 10 # second to the grub menu is more good than harm GRUB_TIMEOUT=10  Access it via idrac

        I&rsquo;ve been creating a fun microservice tool that provides a single API frontend and merges data from multiple backends. Since the app itself relies entirely on external data, I was wondering how in the world I would write unit tests for it. It&rsquo;s written in python using the amazing apistar framework. All of my external data so far is gathered using the requests library. The answer for this, turns out to requests-mock.

My current stack Because I&rsquo;m insane, I decided to give Emacs a try. While I&rsquo;m still pretty pleased with Omnifocus, I do find limitations with it. I also store all kinds of notes in Quiver. Anytime I&rsquo;m working on anything, I keep my notes in Quiver. I had been keeping a worklog in it, but it got goofy when work (and the associated notes) span multiple days.

I cover a couple different things in this post, find the section you want.

        This is a little walkthrough of settng up a &ldquo;production-like&rdquo; vault server with etcd backend (Not really production, no TLS and one person with all the keys). Hashicorp Vault is incredibly easy to setup. Going through the dev walkthrough is pretty easy, but when you want to get a little more advanced, you start getting bounced around the documentation. So these are my notes of setting up a vault server with an etcd backend and a few policies/tokens for access.

        This weekend, I was finally clearing out the bit of walk between my pole barn and the hill behind it. Erosion has been filling it in, making it hard to get back there with any sort of push mower. Vines and brush have been filling in around it. I did what I could with the trimmer, then I went back in with the machete. Now, this machete was $6 at Harbor Freight and I haven&rsquo;t used it much because the cheap plastic handle was starting to break.

        This morning I took a meter I was working on outside so I could take it apart and watch my son run around the yard. I planned ahead and took a box to hold the parts. After I had gotten a couple screws out, the wind picked up and blew my box into the yard. I can&rsquo;t find the funny screws in the grass. I should have left them out of the box.

One commenter said that the ones with a zip-tie slot will also fit nicely into a rack&rsquo;s square hole. I do have a 3D printer on my &ldquo;big ticket wish list&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in the cards for this year.

        At the beginning of this month, I said enough is enough and I forced myself back onto the slow carb diet. Slow carb is really another fancy name for low carbs, but it makes a distinction between complex and simple carbs. You also get a cheat day.
 Rule 1: Avoid &ldquo;white&rdquo; carbohydrates Rule 2: Eat the same few meals over and over again Rule 3: Don&rsquo;t drink calories Rule 4: Take one day off per week  I have been almost exclusively eating steak salads (from Sheetz and Ed&rsquo;s) and avoiding soda/sugar drinks (including diet).

        A few days ago, I read a blog post by André Staltz about &ldquo;AN OFF-GRID SOCIAL NETWORK&rdquo;. I immediately intrigued and I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Amateur Radio. The bulk of all amateur radio traffic takes place as either phone (voice) or CW (morse code). Textual communication is only a portion of the traffic. I have been on and done PSK31 to send real time messages to people that are listening right now.

        Background I&rsquo;ve been wanting to document my home and homelab network for a while now. I used to keep some individual files around with a list of ip addresses and networks, and I used to have a yaml file with the network laid out. But a lot of it was out of date and any time I made a significant change (like adding vlans or tagged interfaces), the entire format would need to change.

        This year, I have made a few new resolutions. One of them is to write more blog posts. This post is the first step towards that. Rather than just naming off a few common resolutions, I spent a couple days working through the exercises in Alex Vermeer&rsquo;s 8,760 Hours: How to get the most out of next year. In my opinion, this is an excellent book. The author and myself used mind-mapping software, but this is also very doable using pencil and paper.

        Worst Practice Lab VM Automation I&rsquo;ve started the process of switching my lab over from unmanaged to ansible. I&rsquo;ve used Puppet and Salt quite extensively through work, but after a handful of false starts with the lab, I think ansible is the way to go.g his is a series of what many (including myself) would consider &ldquo;worst practices&rdquo;, but are more along the lines of &ldquo;rapid iteration&rdquo;. The goal here is to get something working in a short period of time, without spending hours, days, or weeks researching best practices.

 Ceph OSDs: A Ceph OSD Daemon (Ceph OSD) stores data, handles data replication, recovery, backfilling, rebalancing, and provides some monitoring information to Ceph Monitors by checking other Ceph OSD Daemons for a heartbeat. A Ceph Storage Cluster requires at least two Ceph OSD Daemons to achieve an active + clean state when the cluster makes two copies of your data (Ceph makes 3 copies by default, but you can adjust it).

These are just some notes I took as I did my first run through on installing Ceph on some spare ECS Hardware I had access to. Note that currently, no one would actually recommend doing this, but it was a good way for me to get started with Ceph.
Installation Following this guide http://docs.ceph.com/docs/hammer/start/quick-ceph-deploy/

        hstore is an option key=&gt;value column type that&rsquo;s been around in postgresql for a long time. I was looking at it for a project where I want to compare &ldquo;new data&rdquo; to old, so I can approve it. There is a hstore-hstore option that compares two hstore collections and shows the differences.
In reality, an hstore column looks like text. It&rsquo;s just in a format that postgresql understands.
Here, we have an existing record with some network information.

I recently received this &ldquo;Force Communications AMH-350&rdquo; radio. Actually, it was an entire cabinet with a large power supply, an MFJ TNC2 tnc, and an old DOS PC running JNOS. These had active in a tower shed and turned off 3 years ago. The club wanted me to repurpose this packet system for APRS.

        I used to be a big proponent of xmpp. However, over the years my enthusiasm has waned for it. I'm not the only one. Essentially, these days if your chat service is not done over HTTP(s), and if it doesn't have persistence, your chat service is now legacy. Yes, I still enjoy IRC, and I think it's great for ephemeral communications. But in this multi-device, mobile world, it's hard to use IRC as a daily driver for my friends and coworkers.

        Completely unrelated to the post below, I discovered that some has forked a copy of my website on github. I&rsquo;ve actually migrated from the static site to Mezzanine, but the repo is still in place. I was very surprised someone has forked it. I checked the user out and he recently forked a large number of repositories, all related to docker or coreos type things. It appears that &ldquo;builtdock&rdquo; is putting together some sort of platform as a service offering.

        Emacs standing alone on a Linux Kernel. I&rsquo;m not an emacs user, but I thought this was really fascinating. Basically, the author took the linux kernel, a statically compiled copy of emacs, the mount command, and that&rsquo;s it. You could dd that to a hard drive and boot into only emacs. This gets me thinking about what I&rsquo;m going to call SAOS - Single Application OS. Sort of like the python on a chip scene.

        Learning Salt I am just beginning to read up on SaltStack, but I am really liking it. It has a number of things I like from Ansible (separation from code and state), the targeting abilities of mcollective, and the centralized control of Puppet/Chef. Salt can be run masterless, but in a master/minion configuration, it uses a message queue (0mq) to control minions and get information back. All messages in this queue are encrypted using keys on both the minion and the master.

I compared what was out there and other than the Pixel, the C270 had the best specs, including battery life (8.5 hours). It&rsquo;s an Intel chipset, 16GB space, 2Gb of RAM, 1.4Ghz.
The good:  You get a lot of functionality for $200.

        I ordered the KS2 from  - $50/month, 3.4ghz, 16gb ram, and a 1TB software raid setup. My plan is to set this up as a single server virtual datacenter. They also have the SP2 with twice the ram and storage for $90, but I figured I&rsquo;d test out the cheaper option first. I can always upgrade and migrate to a larger server later if I get into heavier usage. The prices are rather cheap and they have scripts that will automatically provision physical servers.

However, from past projects, this is how I learn best. I am somewhat familiar with AWS terms and once made a script in Python to fire up an instance. This was before Amazon came out with their management console, so I imagine things have come a long way since then (hopefully easier).

        Often when creating a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web page, it&rsquo;s very common to find yourself reinventing the wheel over and over again. I know any time I wanted to create a two-column layout, I would have to look at previous works of mine or search the Internet for a decent example. However, I recently came across Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap framework. At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s just a css file that divide your web page into a 12-column &ldquo;grid&rdquo;.

This is a quick little python tip. When experimenting with python commands and modules, it&rsquo;s usually easiest to use the python console interactively, then create your programs later. The downside of this is that sometimes you have to do a bit of typing before you get to the specific command you want to try.
Imagine the following example:
johnh@puppet2:~$ python Python 2.7.3 (default, Aug 1 2012, 05:14:39) [GCC 4.

I do a good bit of work with VMWare vSphere and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to work more with their API. Everything (except console) that you can do in the vSphere client, you should be able to do through a web-based API.
Unfortunately, it seems that VMWare does not provide an SDK for Python, my current language of choice. I could work in Perl or Java, but I want to develop a web application, which I don&rsquo;t want to do in Perl.

The gateone project does not currently provide any init scripts, but this is planned for the future ([Issue #47]). I tried to use one of the scripts in that thread, but I wasn&rsquo;t really pleased with them. The big issue is that gateone.py doesn&rsquo;t fork.

Once I got a rough handle on setting up Puppet, I decided to get Puppet Dashboard working on my puppetmaster (a Centos 6 server) to have a sort of web interface to view puppet statuses. Since I already have the puppetlabs repositories setup from when I installed puppet, this was almost as simple as running &ldquo;yum install puppet-dashboard&rdquo;.
You then go to /usr/share/puppet-dashboard and follow the install guide to get the database working.

        This is a basic walkthrough of getting a slightly complex &ldquo;step by step to install&rdquo; program like djbdns to install under puppet (in this case, under Ubuntu 12.04). It shows building the manifest, testing it, and some possible gotchas.
I am generally following the guide put together by Higher Logic[1], with a few changes of my own.
Step 1: Installation
I use the dbndns fork of djbdns, which has a few patches installed that djbdns lacks.

        I was experimenting with rsyslog to allow remote logging and within 20 minutes, I had two rogue log entries show up from random hosts.
Jan 17 05:00:23 64-181-24-18.unassigned.ntelos.net kernel: Configuring keys for mac:14:5a:05:ad:6b:cd, sc_hasclrkey is set Jan 17 05:01:05 64-181-24-18.unassigned.ntelos.net kernel: Configuring keys for mac:14:5a:05:ad:6b:cd, sc_hasclrkey is set
So what is interesting about this? I&rsquo;m on comcast in PA. The host that sent this is on ntelos.net, or Lumos in (most likely) West Virginia.

        Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working my way through the Ender&rsquo;s Saga audio books. I had read Ender&rsquo;s Game back in grade school, but I didn&rsquo;t know there was a whole series. They&rsquo;re a really good read.. or listen, as the case may be.
I&rsquo;ve been listening to the Ender series in mp3 format. First, I had them on a thumb drive which was read by my car&rsquo;s radio. I find it very convenient that a radio in my car can directly read a thumb drive&rsquo;s file-system and play any audio files found on it.

&ldquo;It Kinda Sucks&rdquo; - John Hogenmiller, USMC
I once owned a regular Bissel bagged vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; For the better part of a decade, I would turn it on and vacuum the floor. Before that, my sister owned the vacuum and did pretty much the same thing.&nbsp; It was a rather boring device that picked up debris from the carpet and would place it in a bag.

        In continuing working with XMPP and Python, I managed to get xmpppy working.
This proved to be particularly tricky because xmpppy uses some outdated modules like md5 and sha. It also relies on some dns functions which no longer seem to work.
 I was able to use the sample script &ldquo;xsend.py&rdquo; that the project provides. The big thing is that I had to specify talk.google.com and the port number directly in the connect command.

        I found that someone has written a perl script geared towards sending alerts from Nagios to XMPP usernames.
http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/wiki/Nagios_jabber_notification
I have downloaded this, but have not yet got it working as of yet, but it does look promising. It took me a while to update all the dependencies for it, but if those were in place, the installation itself is rather simple. That is, the notification script works, but I haven&rsquo;t actually configured nagios as of yet.

        I am getting more and more into the idea of using XMPP for sending messages. XMPP (also known as jabber) is a very open protocol. Anyone can throw up a server, and by publishing a few DNS records, your server can interact with any other XMPP server out there (that is open). For a popular example, anyone can throw up their server with their domain and send messages to someone using Google Chat.

        On one of my customer&rsquo;s devices, the backup software requires that the backups go to a separate partition (or drive). However, the customer only has one raid array and the bulk of the space is in /home. To work around this limitation, I created a raw image file called backup.img, which gets mounted as /backup. After the software performs its local backup, I use duplicity to backup /backup remotely to a backup server at my location (with encryption).

        I am reasonably familiar with Perl and PHP languages. Recently though, I have taken it upon myself to learn Python. I&rsquo;ve played with Python a few times, and it seems to be very powerful with lots of useful functionality under the hood.
For some basic practice, I recommend Learn Python The Hard Way, which is free book by a reputable Python author, Zed Shaw. He makes the book itself available for free as a PDF download or you can purchase it directly.

        A client wanted to make files available available to the web browser from within their LAN and a handful of static IPs without requiring any sort of username or password. This is the web equivalent of a shared, read only folder. This is no big issue, you can create an .htaccess file like so:
 Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from 10.10.0.1&frasl;16
Allow from 127.0.0.1&frasl;32
Allow from 1.1.1.1&frasl;32

        Duplicity is a great little backup tool that can do incremental backups to a variety of different servers (ftp, scp, and Amazon S3).
The Install I am installing on a Centos 5 system which uses the yum tool. I also have the http://rpmforge.net/repository enabled. I need that for librsync and librsync-devel which provides rsync capabilities when the remote file details are not available (like in FTP).
All of these requirements are found on the duplicity main page.

        Yes, it is my time. Last monday on the elliptical: 3 miles = 21:16 (~7 minute mile) Today: 3 miles = 19:26 (~6.5 minute mile) Next time?Â Who knows.Â I am excited about being able to set this pace, however I have to temper that with the understanding that running on an elliptical is much, much easier than running on flat ground. On the 13th, we managed to capture Sean on camera trespassing at my parent&rsquo;s house.

        So I&rsquo;ve been noticing these purple triangles have been invading our trees. Along the roads, trees would be found with this big hollow purple triangle hanging off of it.  What wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent is what they are up there for. If it was just one or two, I&rsquo;d say some kids put them up there (unfortunate kite incident). However, these things are everywhere, giving it a more ominous and official vibe.

        (unless your talking about my worst time). Today the dream has ended and the fantasy has been washed away. After keeping the pace for a whopping 0.2 miles, my shins hurt and I just couldn&rsquo;t make myself go on running. So began my walk home. It&rsquo;s been many months since the elliptical, over a year since I ran anywhere. Riding the bike did little more than delude myself. A 2 mile bike ride on flat ground is not exercise, it&rsquo;s just a way to make you think that you&rsquo;re doing something good.

        I always considered myself a somewhat lazy person. I guess I never really realized how active I was. I knew I was active in the winter of &lsquo;06. I was carrying and climbing ladders, attaching antennas to buildings, pulling cable, and facing off against freezing temperatures on a daily basis. In January of &lsquo;07 my activity level decreased as I stopped doing this, but I was still doing other things for other people.

For the downstairs, I&rsquo;ve slated 6 windows for removal. Over the last few weekends I&rsquo;ve been boarding them over on the outside &ndash; not the typical &ldquo;hurricane safety&rdquo; boarding up, but precisely cutting the OSB to size and attaching it to the outside of the window frame.

I wondered if it was possible for a person to be unable to get addicted to something. Then I wondered if there was even a word for it. Google came up dry at first.

        So far, work down here has been pretty good. I get along with those that I work with, I understand the job, and I&rsquo;ve been able to be valuable with some of the knowledge I picked up along the way.
Now, the place I&rsquo;m working at is not the only place down here that&rsquo;s hiring, but I know that they are looking for people and not getting them in. Right now, it seems like things are pretty slow (and the seasoned workers also say it&rsquo;s kind of slow this time of year) but there are busy times of the day and there will be busy days.

        Some of you may recall that in January I was planning to getÃ‚Â a job to supplement the shop&rsquo;s income.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â At the time I was looking at a company in Hershey, PA that needed &ldquo;weekend workers&rdquo;.Ã‚Â The company decided that they were only going to hire full-time people, and that opportunityÃ‚Â went away. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been searching around, submitting resumes, getting calls and emails from recruiters.Ã‚Â Some really interesting positions have been offered to me.

        It happened on a Tuesday.Ã‚Â I&rsquo;ve never gotten the hang of Tuesdays. This Tuesday started out fairly simple.Ã‚Â Someone I knew was moving and had an air conditioner he no longer needed.Ã‚Â I was told I could have it for free if I got it myself.. otherwise, he would leave it behind.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Free is usually a good price to pay for a known working air conditioner, so I accepted. Last evening, I drove to the house to pick up my purchase.

        A few months ago, I was asked to be an usher at a wedding. For some reason, I decided &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;. I should have thought more about who was making the request. I actually do have varying degrees of dress clothes. I have my military dress uniforms. I have &ldquo;business casual&rdquo; clothes. I also recently purchased a formal suit to wear the last year&rsquo;s Marine Corp Ball. However, none of these will work in this wedding&rsquo;s bridal party.

        April 20th is a pretty popular day. It is the Birthday of Adolf Hitler and Muhammed.

        For those of you that are like me and don&rsquo;t have television service, American Idol is apparently a pretty popular tv show. I read that it&rsquo;s been running for about six seasons now. What&rsquo;s more is that I&rsquo;ve actually seen parts of about 3 or 4 episodes over the last several years. The premise is that people (presumably American, but I&rsquo;m not an expert on this subject) will do karaoke performances on the show, judges will judge them, and then other people will vote for the contestant that they want to stay on the show.

        I have an HP dv1000 Pavilion laptop. Back in &lsquo;05/&lsquo;06, I had this setup with Mepis Linux, dual-booting with Windows XP. Now the thing about this laptop is that it has a Broadcom wireless card (BCM43xx). With Mepis, I used ndsiwrapper to get the card working. However, the screen resolution was never very good, media files would play weird (codes at the time were a bit off, I think), and sometimes when switching wireless networks, the entire system would freeze.

        At first, I started noticing that my phone would beep in the middle of the night.Ã‚Â Upon checking, there would be no missed call, no voice mail, no text message.. nothing on the screen to tell my why it beeped.Ã‚Â Recently, I realized that the phone would beep at 1:13am.Ã‚Â This was the great mystery that I typically didn&rsquo;t think about until oh&hellip; 1:13am. Today however, the mystery has been solved.

Ã‚Â Summer of &lsquo;05 I got home by April sixteenth Deployed for the very last time Prayed that it would end It was the summer of 05 Me and some friends were real cool Had no job but we tried real hard Jenny quit and Curt got fired I shoulda known we&rsquo;d never get bored Oh when I look back now That summer seemed to last forever And if I had the choice Ya - Id always wanna be there Those were the best days of my life Aint no use in complainin When you got a job to find Spent my evenins down at the Denny&rsquo;s And at the Gateway we&rsquo;d play pool Riding in Evil John&rsquo;s car He said that the tree-trimmin was over Oh and even Chris got tanned I knew we&rsquo;d be friends forever Those were the best days of my life Back in the summer of 05 Then around winter time We were no longer jobless We ended up reassigned I guess nothin can last forever - forever, no And now the times are changin Look at everyone thats up and gone Sometimes when I play that old pool thing I wonder if the gang will come along Riding in Evil John&rsquo;s car He said that the tree-trimmin was over Oh and even Chris got tanned I knew we&rsquo;d be friends forever Those were the best days of my life Back in the summer of 05

        i just wanted to say some amazing things about PEX piping. This stuff is simple, and it works. I&rsquo;m not a marketing guys, but here&rsquo;s some things I love about it:
 Smooth-walls: avoid build up of corrosion Flexible: bend it around corners Flexible: will expand to 7 times its size (frozen water) without any lasting effects Simple connectors: Crimp it down, no glue, torch, or threading needed Cheap: 100' costs less than $25 (Zimmerman's/Ace Hardware stores/Lowes) Less measuring -- run what you need and cut off the excess  Anywho, I had the opportunity to do some plumbing last week.

I ran out of oil, so no heat or hot water, my car went on the fritz, Robin wrecked her car, and some new bills started coming my way. So first let me tell you about the car.Ã‚Â I had some bald tires due to a bad alignment, plus the steering was sloppy.

The living room has become my office, my bedroom, and my changing room. This one room stays between 65F and 70F while rest of the house seems to hold around 49F. Anyways, I came home tonight and went up to my living room/office to do some work on the computer.

        New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2006 has come and gone. My &ldquo;party&rdquo; if you can still call it that was a lot smaller than planned, but still an enjoyable evening. The end of December has given me a lot of of time to reflect on the past year or so, on where I am, and think about what I want to do next. Reflection: In April of &lsquo;05, I got home from my second trip to Iraq.

        Always avoid alliteration. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with. Avoid cliches like the plagueÃ¢â‚¬â€they're old hat. Employ the vernacular. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary. Parenthetical words however must be enclosed in commas. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive. Contractions aren't necessary. Do not use a foreign word when there is an adequate English quid pro quo. One should never generalize.

Since events in my life have been moving faster than I have been able to keep up with, I have worked out a few additional goals/ideals/resolutions to work into my existing set. These new ones include:
 I will not (pay to) eat out more than twice per week.

        The times seem so exciting but what&rsquo;s with all the rhyming? I met my girlfriend Robin in December But it feels like we&rsquo;ve been together forever. In March I parted ways with the Marine Corp. I won&rsquo;t be going to Iraq any more. I bought my house in May. It&rsquo;s a nice place to stay. My parents have been married for 40 years. We celebrated with crabs, hot dogs, and beers.

        Many people have debated about the existence and nature of the Internet. While most people generally agree and believe in the general concept of an Internet, some will argue that it isn&rsquo;t truly real. However, the majority of people that do believe in the Internet believe that the Internet can be whatever you believe it to be. &ldquo;What you believe is true for you, and what I believe is true for me.

        Vacation ends. A lovely week down at the beach. Essentially I can just walk barefoot out the door, wander down the hall, down the steps, and I&rsquo;m on the beach. I spent some time in the ocean, time at the pool, but I got sunburnt on the neck during miniature golfing. Robin, who constantly lathered up with sunscreen, got burnt really bad. All in all though, the beach is a nice place to visit, but it&rsquo;s definately not a place I would choose to live at.

        Got up this morning at 2:50 am, left around 3:10, on I-70 around 4am (stopped for gas and to check the luggage rack).
It&rsquo;s now 10am and we&rsquo;re travelling through North Carolina. I&rsquo;m connected via cell, travelling about 75mph on I-95, sharing my connection with Robin via a wi-fi ad-hoc network. I left it open, so if anyone is on I-95 around mile marker 127&hellip; hop on and keep up!

        More time has passed and more things are afoot. I have officially moved into the house, and I even have a sign set up out front (a temporary one). I spoke with my existing landlord about the old property and if we can get someone ready to move in, then I can get out of my lease early.
I have been kept pretty busy trying to balance everything out. Like most of my friends, I actually like keeping busy and having a hectic schedule.

        The best way to find out if things are going on in my life is to see how much I post on here. The more I post, the less is going on.
I&rsquo;ve been eyeing up this house across town that has come up for sale. It&rsquo;s got a full living area upstairs &ndash; 1 bedroom, 1 living room (that is large enough to split into another bedroom), full kitchen and bathroom.

        In keeping with posting about scams that have affected me: I noticed a $10 charge on my bank account this month, and the carge actually reads: &ldquo;WLISHOPPERDISCOUNT 800-889-8776&rdquo;. At first, I just did a search on &ldquo;WLISHOPPERDISCOUNT&rdquo; and came up with shopperdiscountsandrewards.com as the first link. I don&rsquo;t know what I went through that signed me up for the service, but when I called up, they didn&rsquo;t give me any hassle in cancelling the service and refunding the charge.

        so I got up this morning around 8:30 and thought of all those poor people I know that have been up for over 4 hours already and have been hard at work since the sun came up. I could be one of those people, but curiously enough, I am not. I think that&rsquo;s because in the beginning of this month, I parted ways with the Marine Corp. A slow sense of relief begins to roll over me.

        I wanted to bring this comment to the light of day. I got it off of a Techdirt article, and I completely agree with it. I&rsquo;m not saying that people were healthier &ldquo;in the old days&rdquo;, but in my mind, unless you have some known medical condition that says otherwise, getting sick, getting germs, getting the occasional virus, and even some parasites is overall good for you. You should get all this as a child, your immune system then trains itself to fight off and recover from these diseases so they don&rsquo;t affect you as bad later on in life.

        Oh, and I found this today. It&rsquo;s a music video to the song Alive by P.O.D. This has been one of my favorite music videos for a long time &ndash; I love special effects that freeze liquid motion, and they did this one amazingly. Requires Windows Media Player or MPlayer (with appropriate codes). And here is the link.

        Slippery slopes, we all fall in.. what ever happened to my sure footing? Why do I fall down, why do others follow me down? If I miss the signs, will anyone ever give me warning? Who tells me when to stop, when I go too far? Oh well, my fault, my mess to clean. If you know me well enough to know what I&rsquo;m talking about, keep me in your prayers, maybe drop me a line.

        Today I added the word qlol to WikiPedia to see if will become more popular. Essentially, well over a year ago, in rant 128 we were discussing the fact that people don&rsquo;t really laugh out loud when they say &ldquo;lol&rdquo;.. they just type it. So, we coined the term &ldquo;qlol&rdquo; to indicate that while we may be laughing, we&rsquo;re doing it very quietly. I&rsquo;ve been pushing this around to various friends and some of them have started using it on a regular basis, so now I&rsquo;d like to conduct an experiment to see if others will pick up on it and start using it.

        Here&rsquo;s a little something I made up after some recent grocery shopping expeditions.
Shopping at the store, gonna get a lot of peaches
Peaches come in a jar
They were put there by Thailand
Shipped to my town
And if I had money to pay
I&rsquo;d eat peaches everyday

        Grailing or more accurately, Holy Grailing is a time-honored pasttime where one quests for the Holy Grail. There is a lot of different stories concerning this grail, and while no one can agree on what it looks like, everyone agrees that it is lost and that &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know it when you see it.&rdquo;
No one knows where the grail is, which means that it can be anywhere. Additionally, no one knows if the grail is stationary or mobile.

        The Weekend.
I wrote about this weekend in an email first, and then slightly edited it for public consumption.
Friday Chris and Jess came down. We were headed for Hoss&rsquo; before picking up Robin, but the line was long so we went to Ed&rsquo;s instead (Friday night fish fry). Usually, when a place has a fish fry, it&rsquo;s all pretty much made up and ready to go. Chris and I ordered the fish fry, Jess ordered steak.

        I think I&rsquo;ve become addicted. It started out with a busted lip a few months ago, which led to constant chapped lips. So I started using chapstick. I kept using it because my lower lip kept splitting back open whenever it chapped. So I moved up to &ldquo;Carmex&rdquo; which helped, but not enough. Then I stepped up even further a couple weeks ago to &ldquo;White Petoleum Jelly&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t stop using this stuff.

        The year drew to a close, and so does this saga. I don&rsquo;t have my family&rsquo;s Christmas pictures gathered together yet, but the rest of December&rsquo;s is up for viewing.
Some have asked me about New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. I rarely make them, because I make resolutions all the time. This year though, I decided to make one, but I&rsquo;ve actually started it well before the end of the year. I want to remove those things in my life that seperate me from God (bad habits, ways of thinking, etc).

        The saga of the season continues&hellip; So I went down to Kristin&rsquo;s the last two days. Originally, I had an invite to go visit April, and the bulk of my time was going to spent visiting her, with a visit to Kristin in the midst of it. Kristin herself warned me that she was pretty busy, but wanted me to visit. Then, April dropped off the face of the planet, and I had to change my plans to visit Kristin and stay until plans were made with April.

        Another day of Xmas gone by. Yesterday I went over to visit the family for our Christmas and there were all told about 15 of us gathered for the eating of food, exchanging of gifts, and catching up of events.
A few memories that stand out in my mind: The kids all in one room having their "mini" family reunion, all talking excitedly about what they got for Christmas, what they've been doing, and where they recently moved.

Ok, now for today&rsquo;s events (journal like for now, but then I plan to get more rant-like later in the post.

        Hmm&hellip; what&rsquo;s new? Well obviously it&rsquo;s (for many people) Christmas day, unless your Orthodox Christian, in which case that&rsquo;s (I might be wrong on this) January 6th. Anyways, per tradition, my family is having their celebration on Monday. I&rsquo;ll be spending today drifting from family to family, spending time with friends.
Going back a bit in time, traveling up to the present&hellip; I met a nice young lady online about a week ago (this is becoming a theme now, isn&rsquo;t it?

        Oh, why am I one of the few that love winter, loves snow, performs best in cold weather? We&rsquo;ve had our second snow storm of the season (yes, winter hasn&rsquo;t officially started yet, I know &ndash; work with me here). I&rsquo;ve had to shovel the parking lot three times so far. I&rsquo;m not disliking that activity as much as previous years. In fact, it&rsquo;s a great excercise &ndash; but I&rsquo;m usually left standing outside in a t-shirt sweating profusely as the wind whips around me.

        Come home Sunday, walk to my room.. neither the microwave or the fridge are running. So, I check the power strips, unplug, plug back in, no love. Down to the basement, check all the breakers &ndash; only one is turned off. I can&rsquo;t flip it on. Back upstairs, I notice another device plugged into the same circuit, I unplug everything on the circuit and try again. Still&hellip; no love. Hmmm&hellip; the breaker seems a bit loose in the box, so I turn off power to the building, fiddle with it, turn power back on, the breaker turns on, yet no love at the plugs.

        More pictures are up now.. basically I just grouped all of November&rsquo;s (except the ball) into one album. Umm.. not too much going on, I feel like I&rsquo;ve put my life on pause as I try to finish up some projects I&rsquo;ve committed myself to. However, I am getting some good stuff accomplished that will help me out down the road, which is good.

        I set my keys down... I placed them on the ground. The only thing I'd like to know-ow... Is wherever did they go? Oh I set my keys down! Now they can't be fou-ound! Oh where did my keys go? I just set them on the ground. And they don't make a sound-ound. I set my keys down. I'm still looking round. I guess I'm nowhere bound. On the counter, my keys are fou-ound!

        So yeah, it was a good holiday weekend. Met with family, met with friends (both local and long distance ones) and with the exception of some food poisoning (Which was healed within 4 hours, beat that!), I pretty much had a blast all weekend. I mean, healing is just amazing when it happens. Also, I managed to double the list of things that I know one of my long distance friends enjoys doing (bringing the total count to two).

        Turn to the left, turn to the right&hellip; potential problems fly by, I slip through in a frenzy of activity, and then I pause and breath. Take a moment, rock back on my heels, smile my happy smile and sigh. Friends appear, encouragement is shared and shared alike. I do good, I say, and I mean it as well. Time slips past me again, a raging torrent threatening to tear me from my precarious perch.

        Sometimes when you think you have someone figured out, they can pleasantly surprise you. I guess it&rsquo;s all part of growing up. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; the issue has become a non-issue, at least as far as I&rsquo;m directly concerned, no one got injured, and with a flip of the switch, everything slides to the back burner, lowest setting.
So movie night was a decent success. The movies themselves were pretty bad choices.

        So let&rsquo;s see&hellip; a lot has happened, but little has been said. First off, moved the website to a different server, one that I have better confidence in (connectivity wise). I have not collected a drop of unemployment, not now, not ever. I am still living in a hole in the wall, still living on sandwiches, pasta, and handouts, but I am living and paying my bills. It has been over 6 months since my last paycheck of any kind (with no savings to speak of).

        I kind of ranted in haste about something that was troubling me without really giving the other person a chance to talk to me. I forgot today was Friday so I thought that they were ignoring me when I didn&rsquo;t get a call early this morning. Oops. Another apology from me.
This morning I woke up with a lot of clear thinking about a bunch of things. Some things are still tangled in my mind, some things were revealed to me that has made some simple things more complex, and some complex things more simple.

        Still no time for an update, but I figured I&rsquo;d write down some songs I had made up during recent car trips. Your Minions best sung by a lot of burly guys in a bar holding beer mugs
We&rsquo;ve got your back!
We packed a snack!

        Here we are several months home now. My evil twin is no longer &ldquo;freeloading&rdquo; at my place currently &ndash; he has gotten himself employed again. My shop has paid its own bills and occasionally paid for things like food and gasoline. However, it isn&rsquo;t paying everything. I am considering my options at this point. I may have to take that unemployment I&rsquo;ve held off on getting. On one hand, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get the business going on its own steam, but right now it (and me) needs a serious infusion of cash &ndash; all of the extra money has been going into building the cafe, and currently development in that direction has stalled completely.

        I have been having serious problems connecting to this site from my dsl connection, hence the lack of updates. However, I figured I should throw some stuff out here.
 The layout and design of this site sucks. It may have been a cool thing several years ago , but errors and mixed formatting on code are becoming seriously dated. W3C has nothing on this site. Expect an entire site overhaul soon.

        I AM BACK. Well wasn&rsquo;t that fun. While I can plan on not being deployed again, it&rsquo;s now time for me roll the dice and see what life has in store for me. Interesting things are bound to occur. BTW, I&rsquo;ve put out the first issue of JHN (John Hogenmiller News) on The Source of H. How is it that I can simultaneously feel like Mr. Awesome and a looser? I&rsquo;ve climbed rocks, jumped out of windows, been shot at, did my own taxes, dated two strippers at the same time &ndash; from the same club, led a prayer group, out-chugged a chugger, hung drywall, hot-wired a car, sat home alone many a night, walked 3 miles barefoot through town just to say I did, got cut in a knife fight, choke-slammed a Marine, took out the trash, did laundry, and wear open-toe sandals.

Maybe once I get some of this other stuff out of my way I&rsquo;ll post some more updates here.

        I get a bit worried when someone will come up to me and sincerely thank me for something. I respond graciously enough with &ldquo;no problem man&rdquo;, but inside I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;Who is this person and what do they think I did for them?&rdquo; Well, I guess it&rsquo;s better than people coming up and cursing me out for things I don&rsquo;t think I did.

        Happy Saturday! For those of you tuning in back home, then Merry Christmas! Here in Iraq, it&rsquo;s business as usual, just another day. But it is also important to note that for me and my gange, we&rsquo;ve past the halfway point and it&rsquo;s all downhill from here. That is a good cause for celebration. Cheers.

        I talked about it with some people, but now I have finally launched the site Iraq&hellip; again. I am going to put all Iraq-related blog entries and pictures on that site, so start looking there instead of here for a while. Of course, things that are just my usual musings and findings will naturally go here.

        From Slashdot:
Yeah, but&hellip;they&rsquo;re spammers.
It&rsquo;s like the Indiana Jones movies. Melting people&rsquo;s faces is bad. Melting Nazi&rsquo;s faces is awesome. Because, honestly, they&rsquo;re Nazis.
I&rsquo;m not saying spammers are Nazis, just that we should melt their faces.

        Quick update. Dryden is now hosting his pictures on here as well. Check them out. You probably need to get to page 15 or so (can&rsquo;t remember off hand, don&rsquo;t feel like looking it up) before you get to the Fallujah pics. The rest are from Cali and before.

        I figured I should do an update as I haven&rsquo;t done one in a while with all the stuff that&rsquo;s been going on. We reopened the internet cafe about 7 days ago, and people starting coming back in from Fallujah around 6 days ago. They are rotating in for a couple days of R&amp;R, and then back off to the city for 3-4 days. Basically, 4 on, 2 off, and so on.

        We have begun. It was pretty interesting yesterday when everyone was getting staged to go in. Last night, we took out an 8-building apartment complex and secured a hospital. Back here on base, all you can hear is the sound of artillery pounding away, all night and all day. There hasn&rsquo;t really been any incoming. I think the insurgents are being kept pretty busy elsewhere. The next 14 days will be pretty darn interesting.

        I can&rsquo;t say too much of what&rsquo;s going on out here, but I guess if you read the news, you can extrapolate what is going to happen very, very, soon. It&rsquo;s really wild to be part of a new-making organization. Imagine reading about things that happen just outside your door on the news the next day, knowing that people are hearing about it on the tv as well. When a jet breaks the sound barrier and shakes my house, I can read about air strikes on fallujah the next morning.

Me: You can get on 21.
Him: (confused look) what?
M: You can get on 21.
H: Er no, it was already there&hellip;
M: You can get on 21.
H: I just signed up.

        Not a whole lot going on as of late. Things have been pretty slow at the cafe, but we have been bring some serious force to bear down on the insurgents of Fallujah. They&rsquo;ve been retaliating with mortars out by my location, but so far they&rsquo;ve done nothing more than stir up the fish. They were at it again before 5 this morning in fact. These people have no consideration for those that may be sleeping.

        Well, it&rsquo;s been a while since my last update, so here goes. We have had all sorts of connectivity problems here. A crossover cable went bad (intermittenly bad), shutting down internet access. On the phone side, our modem went bad (slowly degrading over time), and then, we got hit by a virus on the computer side and segovia shut us off. These things happen I suppose, but when it all goes on within a weeks time, it tends to be very fustrating.

        Well, I have finally fixed the photo album so that I may upload new pictures. Then, after fixing it, I dedided to go ahead and upgrade from 1.2.1-p1 to 1.4.4-pl2. It has a lot new features (that I may never need), but it changed some of my template files, so the colors are all different now, plus you don&rsquo;t get the links at the top. It seems to have the ability to have headers and embedd itself into webapps, so I may be able to get this fixed in a different way then before.

        I just got news (well, a day or two ago) that a former co-worker and good friend fell ill while on vacation. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with Leukemia. A day later, he went into a coma. Within a day or two, he was taken off of life support and died. The whole thing from feeling sick to death took place within a few days. Mark Strozzi, you will be missed.

        I finally got to get ahold of Danielle last night. The last several times I&rsquo;ve called her, I&rsquo;ve always just missed her. The one time, she was at the fair, the next time she was working a 16-hour shift (and where she works, she&rsquo;s not really allowed on the phone), the day after that I had just missed her leaving the house. However, I called at 1240am our time and got her as she was getting to the house.

        Well, I&rsquo;ve been at the internet cafe for 5 days now and things are working out pretty good. I got a helper, and we worked it out where he takes the morning shift (5am-10pm) and I take the &ldquo;evening&rdquo; shift (8am-midnight) so we both get a decent amount of sleep and both of are covering during the busy times of the day. Some other good news is that I did my laundry and pulled out a fresh set of camies from the ol&rsquo; seabag.

        Well, all worked out well. We got into the air field on the 14th, and made our way into Fallujah by the 16th. They have decent internet access here, but the actuall facilities are crowded. Basically, everything is overcrowded with the number of Marines living here and all the generators are overloaded, meaning we can&rsquo;t run all the &ldquo;niceties&rdquo;, but otherwise the base is pretty nice.

        Touched down in Kuwait last night (9&frasl;11, a very commemorative date) and on our way to Iraq tonight. Things have improved a lot since last time. Lots of niceties, I suppose to contrast the bad situation going on outside the firm bases. Anyways, thanks for everyone&rsquo;s support and prayers. If anyone would like to write:

        Well, when we invaded Iraq last year, it was hailed as the largest inland movement by marines in history. Last night was perhaps the most inefficient movement by marines in history. We boarded a c-130 and took off, flew for about 15 minutes, and then you could feel the plane banking yet again, and sure enough, we were turning around. We landed back in Kuwait due to a hydraulic leak that they somehow didn&rsquo;t catch prior to take off.

        People are incomprehensible. I just got off the phone with someone who called up because they couldn&rsquo;t get connected to the internet. They had a specific error message (error 678) that comes from doing thing correctly to connect. I had them restart the computer and wanted them to try connecting again. We then had to spend 15 minutes helping her find the connect to icon, as well as internet explorer. I just want to scream &ldquo;how the #&amp;)@ did you get nearly connected the first time!

        This was quite a weekend. Thursday started off like any other day.. get up, go to work, leave work. The change came when I got close to home and I decided on a whim to try and call up an old friend of mine (by old, I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that she is older than me) and actually got ahold of her. We talked and caught up on news till I stopped in the local BPs for some Chester Fried Chicken&hellip; the bomb* (*not affiliated with BPs or Chester Fried), where we talked some more before I could even order my chicken, and I got invited out to a biscuit and pepsi party, which got me mightily excited, as you can imagine.

        Scan the cafeteria for some good seating.
Found a spot by the cheerleaders eating.
The quarterback asked me if I&rsquo;d like a beating.
I said that&rsquo;s one thing&hellip; I won&rsquo;t be needing.
And since I am so smart and cunning&hellip; I took off down the next hall running.
Relient K rocks So I took a look at my phone bill today. The total came to $179.12, which is slightly more than I&rsquo;m used to paying (~$54).

        For anyone watching the news (as it relates to Iraq) recently, you may start to notice something. In previous months (ie, between August and now), you may have hear reports like &ldquo;soldiers picked off by drive by shooters&rdquo; or &ldquo;car bomb kill 4 coalition forces.&rdquo; Well, my guys (I&rsquo;m talking Marines here), went back into country this last month. The headlines now read &ldquo;Marines are engaged in heavy fighting across the region&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marines get into firefight with rebels, destroy wall in the process.

        Ok, the first bot is back online. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, SQBNet stands for Squegie Bot Net because of the fact we ran a bot net. With the collapse of the ircnet social structure, the botnet went away, but I continued on with the site. Now, I am getting back into bots, which are one of my favorite things on the internet. A bot is like a robot, but cooler.

        Have you ever thought about when someone says rofl? I mean, they can&rsquo;t be literally rolling on the floor. How would they type? It woudl be tricky that&rsquo;s for sure. You&rsquo;d need a wireless keyboard.
This statement that someone told me would work because they aren&rsquo;t rolling: wow i&rsquo;m definetly like on the floor laughing with that one.
&ldquo;&hellip;investigators say the deceased was on &ldquo;aim&rdquo; a popular online chat program, when she started to &ldquo;rofl&rdquo;, which means rolling on the floor lauging.

Should I type that in now?
Yes. And then hit next.
silence
Um&hellip; did you hit next?
It&rsquo;s asking for my email.
Type your email into that box.
Ok.
after a pause &hellip;and hit next.
My incoming mail server is a &ldquo;P&rdquo; &ldquo;O&rdquo; &ldquo;P&rdquo; &ldquo;3&rdquo;.
It certainly is. Now, in both of the boxes below, type &ldquo;mail.domain.dom&rdquo;
Ok.

        A lot of people I know believe that weight is proportional to quality. The heavier a device is, the more &ldquo;solid&rdquo; it is, and therefore, a more reliable/higher quality device. &ldquo;Feel the weight of this power supply.&rdquo; or &ldquo;This cell phone has more weight to it, which indicates higher quality components.&rdquo;. Now, to be fair, there is some truth to this. A heavier power supply typically means a larger transformer, which is able to handle higher loads.

        Some of you were expecting a different rant #108, and I&rsquo;m sorry to dissapoint you. Stay tuned for rant #109 though. For those who have no clue what they&rsquo;re missing, let me tell you. A local fellow recently has been having trouble with his laptop&rsquo;s power adapter. I had bought him a new adapter (with his money mind you), and then he had problems with that one, so I replaced the new one.

        The following rant was submitted by windex/theinx/theOracle/redinx at my request. When I first heard the story of the borrowed floppy drive, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. However, strange as it seems, the following story is true. We just can&rsquo;t make stuff like this up.
So, Squegie asked me if I knew anyone who is into graphics design and could create a logo for one of his websites. I told him I knew of someone who was between jobs and looking for something interesting to do besides calculus homework, so I passed the word along.

        For those of you who have been watching the space from rant 105 and are feeling a bit put out, let me put your fears to rest. The non-geek in this story is the friend in rant 109, while the geek in 105 is the ex-boyfriend in 109. The co-worker&rsquo;s computer in rant 109 is as of yet an unknown entity.

        I have found something worse than spam. When people spam using your email address, you get the bounced messages. What makes that even worse is when tons of people who have received spam from your email adress (but not necessarily you) get infected with a virus, your address is in their list. So, you will either a) get the spam victims&rsquo; virus email, or b) the spam victim&rsquo;s computer will send messages from your email address and you will get the virus scan bounce backs alerting you that you had a virus or your message was rejected.

        Watch this space. I&rsquo;ve been hearing about the breakup of a geek/non-geek relationship and the troubles it has caused the non-geek in dealing with her computer. I heard about about it because the non-geek girl has created a logo for me, and it is on this computer. More to come as this rant unfolds.

        Of course, there is nextel. I never really cared about cell providers before. It used to be just a comparison of minutes/dollar/month and coverage area. I had long ago bypassed the coverage area problem by getting a national no roam plan with the V provider. I recently went to check out Nextel&rsquo;s no roam plan, which led me to realize how arrogant Nextel is.
Nextel does not allow other phones onto its network.

        Christmas is here&hellip; time to go shopping, I say. There is nothing like places open 24 hours and last-minute panic to inspire holiday gift giving. I always shop at the last minute, not because I&rsquo;m a procastinator (which I am), but because I generally don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s the last minute till that minute is upon me.
I hardly notice holidays at all&hellip; most of them show up on the radar, I hear other people talk about them, and then they are past.

Something is bound to snap, something is bound to break. The pressure builds, and I push harder. I must change course before all is lost.

        Argh! People are crazy sometimes. People seem to think that because I&rsquo;m a relatively smart guy, that I&rsquo;m somehow above them. As if being intelligent puts me beyone reproach, beyond question. Not only is this not true, I&rsquo;m not even that smart! I am no genius, I am no scientist. I have one specialized area that I&rsquo;m really good at, and people take that to mean that I&rsquo;m intelligent in many areas.

        Time for me to move. It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that I took a hand in liberating Iraq. We conqured that country, toppled a regime, and established order. The people of that country would always be coming up to me and my brothers to thank us for helping them. Then, we handed control over to others and moved on. Now, I see that the occupational forces we turned the country over to are not up to the job.

        I&rsquo;m considering opening up the ability for other people to rant or &ldquo;blog&rdquo; on this site. If anyone is interested in doing so, or would like to see it done, email me. I&rsquo;m still mulling it over.

        For the last three years, I have been training with the United States Marine Core, and now I have been called to put that training to use. For security reasons, I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly where I&rsquo;m going, and how long I&rsquo;ll be there, but I will be gone, and most likeley unable to get to my email. For those of you that want to contact me, try to call the store first (866-470-TECH).

        In February 1999, a team of researchers from Harvard University led by Lene Vestergaard Hau used the BEC to slow lightâ€”which normally travels at 186,000 miles per secondâ€”to just 38 miles per hour by shining a laser light through the condensate. In 2001, Hau&rsquo;s team announced that it had briefly brought a light beam to a complete stop.

        It&rsquo;s 11am.. the phone rings. Being a considerate person, I answer the phone. me: Hello?
her: Hey it&rsquo;s me. Did I talk to you last night?
me: (Thinks back a bit) Yes, yes we did.
her: Oh, ok. I wasn&rsquo;t sure, I don&rsquo;t really remember much of anything last night.
me: Oh really? I remember every word (what did we talk about anyways?)
We go back and forth a bit like this, ending up with me revealing that we had worked out some wedding plans and were going to get married sometime within the next two weeks.

        Ok, organizing the pictures was easier than I thought it would be. I did a lot of moving of pictures, so the link in the last update is now invalid, but will at least put you in the proper album. Also, for family members, I have a hidden album.

        Aquavit is also considered useful for medicinal purposes, an essential ingredient in what I was once told is the Norwegian cure for the common cold. You get a bottle, a poster bed, and the brightest colored stocking cap you can find. You put the cap on the post at the foot of the bed, then get into bed and drink aquavit until you can't see the cap. I've never tried this, but it sounds as though it should work.

        Notice: This rant has been edited from previous. All I have edited has been the link presented and added this part on the top
I had a link that looked like this: http://www.pennswoods.net/~dbrantner/rants.html which has since changed from the original to a page which redirected you to a gay porn popup loop. To actually get to the site, you&rsquo;ll have to navigate through from the home page: http://www.pennswoods.net/~dbrantner/
Over the last year, this site has grown and changed and generally mutated as I have thought of new ideas to test out here.

        If the Jim, The Aussie (www.jimtheaussie.com happens to be coming to a club near you, and you happen to be the kind of person that likes humorous people, then I would recommend you go and watch his show. If however, you are the kind of person that despises humour, or perhaps Australians are not your cup of joe (or tea for that matter), then I would recommend not going to see his show.

        I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s Turkey Day again. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Turkey Day (also known as Thanksgiving) is a day set aside (mostly by US citizens) to give thanks for all the blessings that they have received. All in all, not a bad day, not a bad concept. Since I actually have what I consider to be a good life, good friends, and what is generally considered to be a promising future, I have many things to be thankful for.

 You know, One could just buy a *new* vehicle, with a decent warranty, that would pretty much guarantee 7 years or 70K miles of worry-free driving, given regular maintenance. Just a thought. ;) Jenn P.S. Toyotas rock.

        Ok, let&rsquo;s look at this. Real world scenario. My friend bought a 2001 (in 2001) Hyundai Tiburon bought for $15,500 and pays $367/month . Hyuandai has one of the best warranties on the market. About the same time that my Jeep broke down, his Tiburon lost first gear. His vehicle and my vehicle are in the shop getting repaired. My repair will cost me $500 tops, which is significantly less than two months payment of the Tiburon.

        A used car is a great thing. It&rsquo;s very cheap, it will get you to the places that you need to go. They will stick with you throught think and thin, and will never let you down. That is of course, until you absolutely, positively, need it to work. A used car is more aware of your financial situation than you are. If you can&rsquo;t afford to put gas in it, much less repair it, the car will run.

I share them with you n ow in hope that it will help others to be as happy as I am.  Bad things happen, murphy's law is in full force at all times. If something good happens, treat it like a singular miracle and be happy.

        I was working in the shop today, and from time to time, I worry when 2 or more computers I&rsquo;m working on have the same problem, and it&rsquo;s usually severe. I start to suspect that the coincidence is too great for this to happen, and then start doubting my technical troubleshooting abilities. Tonight I was doing this on two computers I had replaced the motherboards on, a premio and a gateway.

        For those of you who don&rsquo;t already know, we had our Marine Core ball on the 9th up at the Ramada. This year, I took harlei, who is pictured elsewhere on this site under a different name. The day was doomed from the start.
It all started the Friday beforehand. I drove up to my parents&rsquo; place where I keep my uniforms. I had (one month prior) placed my alpha&rsquo;s into a uniform bag and driven it up to the center for tailoring, and presumably drove it back to my parents&rsquo; place for safekeeping.

        I&rsquo;ve been tired lately. I try to compare my sleeping schedule now with schedules held in the past. Basically, I work from 7am till 8pm, which is nothing new. This means I need to be up from 6:30 till around 9pm. However, I stay up till around midnight or 1am some nights of the week and go to bed by 11pm other nights. This gives me anywhere from 5.5 to 7.

        I did however, go running again last night. It was an easy run, somwhere around 2.25 miles through town. I didn&rsquo;t have a watch to time myself with, so I don&rsquo;t know how fast I ran it in, but it probably isn&rsquo;t an impressive time anyway. After running, I feel more on top of my game, which should be motivation enough for me to run in and of itself.

        I am currently going through a business relationship breakup. I won&rsquo;t go into too many details, but basically it involves a friend of mine who I had planned to add as a business partner/owner. Things were going great, and I was planning on drawing up an ownership agreement for us (which needed to be done before December rolled around for tax purposes), when he suddenly declares that I am not doing my share of the work (we were both working in my store, acting as owners/partners before anything official was done), and had spoken with an attorney about taking the business from me.

        I picked up a bad reputation over inManchester today.
Squegie has quite a potty mouth. 1.6% words were foul language. For example, like this:

        So I was thinking about opening a pr0n shop on the internet the other day when I realized that I had no pr0n of my own to sell to people. I immediately set out to make some pr0n when I further realized that I had no one to model for my pr0n shop. This set me back for a minute until I came up with a brainstorm. I knew that the walls in my apartment were naked, so I took many revealing snapshots of these walls.

        Klez.E is the most common world-wide spreading worm.It&rsquo;s very dangerous by corrupting your files. Because of its very smart stealth and anti-anti-virus technic,most common AV software can&rsquo;t detect or clean it. We developed this free immunity tool to defeat the malicious virus. You only need to run this tool once,and then Klez will never come into your PC. NOTE: Because this tool acts as a fake Klez to fool the real worm,some AV monitor maybe cry when you run it.

        Driving home last night, I was taking the alleys through town, heading over to my office building. As I prepared to pull onto the main street for the short period that I had to, I waited as one car drove by, and then I saw a pair of flashing lights as one of the local coppers gave chase to this vehicle. I waited for the copper to drive by, plus the car behind it, and pulled out myself.

        So this was another one of those days. As some of you may know, the 4th of July is a day that America supposedly celebrates its independence from Britain.
We do this through various means, waving flags, shooting fireworks into the sky.. that sort of thing. I celebrated by going up to this fair type thing that they were having in Martinsburg. Tickets were $1.75, which got you onto one (1) ride.

        It&rsquo;s been a while, but that&rsquo;s fine. Just wanted to let everyone (except for you of course) know that a major overhaul is in the works for this site as I prepare to take this site into the next 3 months. I also have some pictures of a certain squegie, certain western coastline, and certain inx that I will soon be posting up online, as soon as I fix my photo gallery program.

        I&rsquo;ve been sitting here, in front of my computer, yet my thoughts are thousands of miles from home. I&rsquo;ve recently set out on a quest to find out something, but I do not think I will be able to find that out (it is the answer to the question that must be answered). I was hoping to make decisions, or beging planning on making decisions based upon my findings this week, but I am discovering that more, oh so much more, time is needed.

you get to play with the lights once and then its off to the basement to look in two rooms and from that figure out which switch controls which room?

        The plans are set, the deed is done. As it stands right now, my course is set, there will be no deviation. All that is left for me to do is to go through the motions, and to learn of the end result. Then, you take that end result and feed it back into the master plan. Currently, the plan can only succeed, not fail. The results may not be what I have expected, but they will be results nonetheless.

Welcome back, those of you who are returning from places unknown (Texas perhaps?). This has been a busy time for the Squegi`, people running everywhere. I myself have been madly coding things for the project. The aptly named carver aka silentc (the c is silent) has managed to go from head technician to actual supervisor, as well as documentation writer for the PennSwoo. Suddenly all of Antioch (the is now in a PennSwoo authority position, forming a mega-block of PennSwoo virtual power.

        Exciting times, boring times, these we can be assured, do exist. First off, I reinstalled my computer. I figured I would give W2k a try as I have not used W2K yet (although I have used NT workstations before). I went through a mad distro, from RH 7.2 to Debian, onto Turbo Linux (which is not that bad), and then a quick stint with Beos, and now I am running Slack on my laptop, and testing out windows 2k on my home puter.

        Have you ever been in a situation where someone has asked you a question, and they need the answer, and you need to give them the answer, and you don&rsquo;t know the answer? It&rsquo;s not something that you can look up in a reference book, or on the internet, but must come straight from you. The problem with these type of questions is that if you don&rsquo;t know the answer, it will keep nagging at you until you have the answer.

        Lot of stuff to talk about. Something like two weeks prior to today, I moved into an apartment with carvo and the aptly named &ldquo;josh&rdquo;. This leads to a new era in the life of Squegie. Now that I am living back in town, work is much closer to drive to. Furthermore, we are all very much computer&hellip; enthusiasts. Therefore, we have a lan. I&rsquo;m getting into multi-player online games like Q3A, and my old favorite, GTA2.

        My newest niece was born on the 25th at 5:27am, weighing 9.1lbs and 20inches in length. Check it out. You know, while at the hospital I was privy to a revelation. Hood-rats in the area will actually go to the hospital to hang out. That seems eternally sad to me. I witnessed three of them getting thrown out by the security guard. Apparently these teens go there, get something from the snack bar, and then wander the grounds.

        You know, I think it&rsquo;s high time that we still with the Bill Bashing. Sure, he used to squash the competition with limitless pools of money and strong-arm tactics, but after all the man is dead. He was shot on December 2, 1999 by a sniper in MacAuthor Park by Alek Hidell. Or so the District Attorneys office would have us believe. But there remains many questions about this case: Why were no fingerprints found on the alleged murder weapon?

        I have gotten tired of constantly spending money at the soda machine for iced tea. Furthermore, making iced tea is time consuming and the tea doesn&rsquo;t last very long. The part I dislike the most is the quantity of trips I must make for beverages. My solution is to purchase a gallon of bottled water from the local grocery outlet. Since my intent is to drink from this bottle, I need something slightly unlike the traditional gallon jug.

        Well, I got the webalizer going again. You can now see the bare minimum of traffic that this sight receives. Excellent. I was excited when it came up with 4 hits for the entire month of December, but unfortunately, that&rsquo;s only because the logs were goofed up. You see, most people like to have lots of visitors to their site. I on the other hand would prefer the opposite. Repeat visitors expect new content all the time.
