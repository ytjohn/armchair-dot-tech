  <p>A few months ago, I was asked to be an usher at a wedding.  For some reason, I decided &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;.  I should have thought more about who was making the request.
I actually do have varying degrees of dress clothes.  I have my military dress uniforms.  I have &ldquo;business casual&rdquo; clothes.  I also recently purchased a formal suit to wear the last year&rsquo;s Marine Corp Ball.  However, none of these will work in this wedding&rsquo;s bridal party.  So, I got measured for the official tux outfit.
A few days ago, I was told the news that the tux rental would be approximately $100.  A one day rental of a piece of clothing is $100?!?.  That&rsquo;s about what my suit cost.   I looked on nextag in disbelief. Most tuxedos range from cheap ($70), with most being around $140, and a few expensive ones actually ring in at $500.  There is one tux by a brad name of &ldquo;Collezioni&rdquo; that runs $700.  I figure that if a tux gets around 20 uses out of it in its lifespan (it should get a lot more, I would imagine), you can rent it at 1/10th the price and double your money.  So, taking the most expensive tux I can find ($700 Collezioni),  it would be $70.  At 1/9th, it&rsquo;s $77.  At 1/8th, it&rsquo;s $87.50.  Finally, at 1/7th, it becomes $100.
All of this is completely pointless though because I&rsquo;m stuckg for &ldquo;the privilege of wearing&rdquo; some overpriced garments.  I guess it&rsquo;s another lesson learned (don&rsquo;t get involved with people that are overly concerned about image and name brands) &ndash; I just would prefer it if these lessons didn&rsquo;t cost so much.
Of course, I am to be best man at my evil twin&rsquo;s wedding next year.  However, I feel on much safer ground in that arrangement (should it truly transpire) than I do with the events surrounding this coming June.</p>
