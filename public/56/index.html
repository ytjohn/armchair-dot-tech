  <p>Ok, Jenn responded to my response, I posted her response and my reply here. Since the whole thing was in email, I&rsquo;m going to make use of the pre tags again, bear with me if it messes things up.<br /><br />A rebuttal to the response to the rebuttal (BTW, this is going on sqbnet).<br /><br />&gt; OK, let&rsquo;s add it up another way.<br />&gt;&gt; 2001 Toyota Tacoma - around $15,000 total (taxes and everything). Six<br />&gt; thousand down, and the other $9K at 7.5% is still a payment of around <br />&gt; $180 a month.<br /><br />$6000 down. At my average of $500/running&amp;inspected vehicle, that&rsquo;s 12<br />vehicles right there. I could run one/month with reasonable assurance.<br /><br />&gt; I have a 3 year/30K mile unlimited warranty, plus a 7 year/70K warranty<br />&gt; on the powertrain. Toyotas have a good reputation for quality, so I<br />&gt; don&rsquo;t see any reason why the truck won&rsquo;t last me for 100K miles without<br />&gt; anything except regular maintenance. So, for roughly 7 years (~12K<br />&gt; miles a year), I will have spent exactly 2 hours shopping for and<br />&gt; purchasing a vehicle, and 0 hours of downtime due to unexpected vehicle<br />&gt; repairs, not to mention considerably less frustration. Plus, my shiny<br />&gt; (OK, OK, dirty) new truck is simply quite cool.<br /><br /><br />Toyota makes an exceptional vehicle, I don&rsquo;t deny that. However, you<br />can&rsquo;t honestly expect me to believe that in the next 2 years, you won&rsquo;t<br />require some sort of unexpected repairs. You may feel statistically<br />secure, but this is the real world, and nothing that states what side of<br />percentage sign you&rsquo;ll be on. Statistics are higher for older vehicles (or<br />more accurately, higher mileage vehicles, for example my 312,000+ mileage<br />buick skyhawk) to break down, but there is still a high number of older,<br />high-mileage vehicles on the road today. Furthermore, in addition to<br />engine/powertrain performance, all vehicles face the same potential of a<br />blown tire, random patch of ice -&gt; tree, and falling airplanes.<br /><br /><br />&gt; For those among us who choose the vehicles that are, shall we say, more<br />&gt; advanced in years, the tradeoff of a lesser average monthly payment is<br />&gt; offset by a variety of factors. First, the time lost to not having a<br />&gt; vehicle because it is in the shop. In my college days of driving cars<br />&gt; older than my siblings, I can count at least 2 work days plus 5 school<br />&gt; days lost due to lack of transportation. (No, there is no such thing as<br />&gt; bus service where I lived.) I am certain that those 5 days of lost<br />&gt; educational potential decreased my GPA significantly enough to cost me a<br />&gt; job making thousands of dollars more per year. OK, probably not, but<br />&gt; let&rsquo;s just say so for the sake of argument. :) But the point remains,<br />&gt; while I never have a care in the world about my car breaking down<br />&gt; randomly (say, while going to the Marine Corps Ball?), and spare myself<br />&gt; the costs of Tylenol for the headache, or worse yet, a stress-related<br />&gt; personal breakdown requiring thousands of dollars of professional mental<br />&gt; help, others who choose the way of the old car are not so fortunate.<br /><br /><br />The impact of lost days depends on the situation and value you personally<br />place on them. For example, the Marine Corps is concerned more with<br />accountability than punctuality. When asked, the platoon sgt can identify<br />the location of every marine under his/her charge. So, my breakdown was<br />insignificant on the face face of things.<br /><br /><br />Secondly, if fustration from being stranded could lead you to headaches<br />and possible personal breakdown, then you may already need professional<br />mental help. Picture loosing your last 2 quarters to a vending machine,<br />traffic jams, breaking a key in the lock, vcr eating your tape, dropping<br />your monitor down a flight of stairs, and having paperwork blow out of<br />your hands. You can either take these as stress, or accept it as<br />something that happens, one of the risks you take in life, and move on.<br /><br /><br />&gt; Time is money, is it not? So, let&rsquo;s say you spend an average of 4 hours<br />&gt; (one afternoon) per vehicle purchase. Multiply that by what you make an<br />&gt; hour (more, I think, for me than for you, but it&rsquo;ll still give you an<br />&gt; idea.) For me, that amount of time makes up the difference in car<br />&gt; payments for 1 month. So I am slowly carving away the difference.<br /><br /><br />Time is money, time is money. That&rsquo;s more of a philosophy than anything<br />else. There is an opportunity cost involved with anything, but not<br />neccessarily a monetary value/cost. I could spend 4 hours valued at<br />$25/hour (for non-math wizes reading this, that&rsquo;s roughly $100) buying a<br />car or watching two movies every 8 or so months. BTW, I&rsquo;ve been doing<br />this for 5 years, and have had 5 different vehicles, most of which were<br />under $300, but with repairs and everything I&rsquo;ve had under $2200 into<br />them. My 6th vehicle is the buick skyhawk which i&rsquo;ve had somewhat under<br />$1200 into. My Jeep I have had $500 into so far, and will be putting $500<br />more into it, which will bring my total to 7 vehicles, $4500. I hadn&rsquo;t<br />added everything up in my last estimate, but this brings my overall<br />average to $75/month with no money down over $500. Keep in mind that for<br />almost two years of that time, I had two vehicles, and not just one. For<br />a good portion of this time, I would average at a minimum, 40 miles/day.<br />For one of those years, my bare minimum was 100 miles/day, more like<br />150miles/day (college being 50 miles away, work being 20 miles away,<br />college each weekday morning, work every day). Furthermore, one of these<br />vehicles took me to Jacksonville, NC and back, 500 miles each way. To be<br />fair, I didn&rsquo;t attend college in the summer, so it wasn&rsquo;t the full year.<br /><br /><br />&gt; At least with my insurance company, if I insure my car (which is<br />&gt; required by law in this state), I can&rsquo;t later call and uninsure the car<br />&gt; so long as I still own it. My brand new truck cost LESS to insure than<br />&gt; my 8 year old Geo Storm (I will grant you, that Geo was considered a<br />&gt; sports car for insurance purposes&hellip; <em>sigh</em>), and less than 20% more<br />&gt; than my 14 year old Mitsubishi Galant. I guarantee you, your insurance<br />&gt; on two older cars is more than my one new truck. Plus, you&rsquo;re a male<br />&gt; under 25 years of age, which practically sentences you to bad insurance<br />&gt; rates. (It&rsquo;s not much better for females anymore, so don&rsquo;t take it too<br />&gt; personally.) And the more vehicles you own, the more insurance you have<br />&gt; to pay. This one&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.<br /><br /><br />Here is a situation that seems to have more to do with the state you live<br />in (which is another topic of debate entirely) than the cost of owning a<br />car. In my state you are required to have insurance on your car in order<br />to drive it. However, a parked car does not require insurance. However,<br />if you move the car across the street without insurance, you risk a fine.<br />My insurance company actually will allow me to cancel service with them if<br />I do not need it (I would be somewhat opposed to it otherwise). I can<br />cancel and add vehicles individually of each other without cancelling the<br />entire policy. I actually went through the added expense of maintaiing<br />insurance on two vehicles, instead of one at a time, mostly because I was<br />planning on using one for strictly business and one for strictly pleasure.<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; Second to last point, at your rate of acquiring 4 cars per year, well,<br />&gt; you&rsquo;d need a place to store all those vehicles. Randomly selecting a<br />&gt; lot of one acre for your ever-increasing fleet of cars, trucks, vans,<br />&gt; jeeps, etc., at local prices, that would set you back around $40K.<br />&gt; Dividing that cost between the differ
ence in price of your fleet and my<br />&gt; truck, amortized over the life of my loan and vehicle and your fleet,<br />&gt; that comes out to.. Well, I come out ahead in the end, because I said<br />&gt; so.<br /><br /><br />That&rsquo;s exactly why I don&rsquo;t create such a fleet. However, in my particular<br />situation, I do have enough (wasted/unused) space to store upwards of<br />vehicles, so I could potentially maintain a fleet of 20 vehicles. I can&rsquo;t<br />put that into the figure due to it being somewhat unique to my situation,<br />but enough people around here fall into the same category that it could be<br />done. Actually, undeveloped land (no house, no perk test, etc..) sells<br />locally for $9,000 or less. However, the potential remains to maintain a<br />group of cars, keeping only the best of the lot, and selling off the<br />&ldquo;lesser of the lot&rdquo; to either a junkyard or private buyer. You run the<br />risk of becoming a used car saleman, which is another reason I don&rsquo;t<br />maintain a fleet at the cost of your truck. Remember $6000 down is 12<br />vehicles, the remaining $9000 could almost purchase that acre of<br />undeveloped ground (with a rate under 7%), and dividing the mileage<br />between 12 vehicles will increase their life span exponentially, as well<br />as thoroughly allowing you to eliminate downtime. If one vehicle is<br />making a weird clicking noise, you can switch to another while having the<br />trouble car in the shop.<br /><br /><br />Yes, I know there are more costs involved with owning land than the $9000<br />you bought it with, and that model will end up being more expensive<br />initially than one vehicle bought for $15,000. However, you can own land<br />forever and use the untapped space for other nefarious purposes (say, a<br />storage shed, or a quasi-house with no running water).<br /><br /><br />&gt; Finally, I had a really great last point to make, but I have forgotten<br />&gt; it by now. Thus, it must not have been that great. But fear not, I<br />&gt; will come through in the clutch and make the most overwhelmingly superb<br />&gt; point of the whole matter, clinching my victory in this debate -<br /><br /><br />You may want to make that point in short order, because you&rsquo;ve so far<br />proven that you&rsquo;re laboring under a belief that your vehicle&rsquo;s internals<br />are invulnerable, the world ends when your vehicle stops, and the time<br />lost searching for a vehicle is worth more than the time watching a movie<br />or playing a computer game. Vehicle hunting can be just as fun, sort of<br />like a quest. Get a couple of friends along for the ride and turn it into<br />a group outing.<br /><br /><br />&gt; Only a damn good looking <em>new</em> truck like mine is worthy of driving over<br />&gt; the one and only world-famous speed bump.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The End<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
