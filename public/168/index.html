  <p>Here we are several months home now.  My evil twin is no longer &ldquo;freeloading&rdquo; at my place currently &ndash; he has gotten himself employed again.  My shop has paid its own bills and occasionally paid for things like food and gasoline.  However, it isn&rsquo;t paying everything.  I am considering my options at this point.  I may have to take that unemployment I&rsquo;ve held off on getting.  On one hand, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get the business going on its own steam, but right now it (and me) needs a serious infusion of cash &ndash; all of the extra money has been going into building the cafe, and currently development in that direction has stalled completely.  I guess that in reality, I&rsquo;ve been paying into unemployment since I was 16, so taking some of that back in order to save my business isn&rsquo;t so bad&hellip;  it still feels like a cop-out however.  Over the last 3-4 days, there really hasn&rsquo;t been any need to get out of bed &ndash; business usually picks up when school starts, but now it is dead.  I think that higher gas prices are to partly to blame.  How am I supposed to funnel money from the wicked to just if none of it is coming my way?
<br />
<br />
On a more personal note, I have put my overal social/dating life on hold for the time being.  I have my &ldquo;core&rdquo; of friends, my click, my knuckles that I see regularly, but the act of going out, meeting new friends, and dating is getting put on the back burner.  I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if there actually are any single Christian women near my age in the area.  I am a single-white Christian male that practices abstinence, which puts me in a very small minority it seems.  As I look around at women my age, I mostly come across one of the &ldquo;nons&rdquo;.  Non-single, or non-Christian, or non-childless.  I don&rsquo;t have anything against children, but I am waiting till marriage to have sex.  My partner needs to have that same commitment, to understand and respect that.  I have it on good authority and dating experience that a born-again virgin is even rarer than an actuall virgin.  They may say that they&rsquo;re going to wait this time, but the invitation is out there. <br />
So I&rsquo;m a bit picky when it comes to women.  I have this thing for smart, attractive Christian women that share some of my ideals.  I&rsquo;ve decided that I am too picky to be going out and looking for a match&hellip; I will bide my time and wait for one to enter my life.</p>
