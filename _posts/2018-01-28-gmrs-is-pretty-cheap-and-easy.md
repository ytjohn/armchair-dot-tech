I got myself a GMRS license 2 years ago. They are $80 for 5 years, and they allow an entire "immediate" family  to use it. That's spouse, children, parents, in-laws. I thought I was going to put play around with some GMRS repeater/text data modes, never did.

Flash forward to more recent. Picked up a 4-pack of Baofeng BF-888S radios. These go for about $13 apiece and $42 for a 4-pack. They're 2-watt radios, and channelized (16 channels).  Program with a computer, dead simple for others. Gave one to my wife's sister who lives 2 miles down the road. She can talk crystal clear to my son from inside her house. I drove around town with one able to talk to my son as well. 

FRS is limited to specific radios and 1/2 watt. GMRS allows 5W on FRS shared frequencies and 50 watts on dedicated. Amateur radio requires a control operator to be physically near the radio. This costs a license fee, but it's pretty cheap, especially in my case if you consider 4 people will be using it. We could even put a repeater on the roof, or some higher powered vehicle antennas if desired (though we probably won't).
