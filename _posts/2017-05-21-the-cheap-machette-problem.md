This weekend, I was finally clearing out the bit of walk between my pole barn and the hill behind it. Erosion has been filling it in, making it hard to get back there with any sort of push mower. Vines and brush have been filling in around it. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hi4uiNnzFkq8dMAVxuE9NzdbgcujPTZzJe2OPLxyHOyyh_Sl2bp1UuE0XcizbAHc-Ne1LZBBa7S3oNuV9vryHWux_LKVLYXoJPIy7UmAg-DKb4hoLZ0dQ5EQwOIFnpZvqdNd3qSSX2Cd1-ge8rwtKxHvyRPaNQooBGYAoobxsCA2RUs1l7s3HPVAFn1FhuKYEm2IzrjGg67PQoUwp7jt6b0JBJBBBlyyq9V39W0DB5vNaBza8vpOAR5xSsoprHI9znLz-aN9LWjsa8e-2TfzZXzyzJoqlgmHSGzKJhmW_QuSQrh66Yo7bFz6_T-VL4Bfqc2Les9KsgqrhJfq_RhCgTyUH1xlJiNCEhwwe6zAWQl2K3wFuNYGSOgR0niIPRQlrX0wHym3q1X7dtgahvVgi3xPL60vhWyK0U-XABFnRifbKC3AhXHlQ7yHsTVJqY6ECwL53d0FkvCsJfnhOpTjer1412rGlbOl3O3EX-EnKhVewqhOzGvucXuIkqx72xbAm0kOa_RuASI2sNrlFD6AdALlrGGkz2SA5WgjH-7o82wJFCgGtqRNQNfJdLthzwCJP-xJ4gYcJcux1qIdGXOS45rkZB51vwOcWlJT7FPKSDQdFsaCeR-pJg=w868-h1542-no" alt="pole barn brush area" width=108 height=192 alight="right"/>
I did what I could with the trimmer, then I went back in with the machete. Now, this machete was $6 at Harbor Freight and I haven't used it much because the cheap plastic handle was starting to break. 

I didn't get a before photo, but one can see the kind of brush I was dealing with slightly up the hill. It wasn't long before the handle was completely apart. The blade was fine, but the only thing holding the handle on the blade was.. my hand. I eventually ditched the handle, wrapped the base with 550 cord, and was able to finish, though my rope handle too started to unravel.
