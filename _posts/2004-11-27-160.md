I talked about it with some people, but now I have finally launched the site <a href="http://www.iraqagain.com/">Iraq... again</a>.  I am going to put all Iraq-related blog entries and pictures on that site, so start looking there instead of here for a while.  Of course, things that are just my usual musings and findings will naturally go here.
