Ok.<br>
Hit next.<br>
I don't have a next.  The one box is still empty.<br>
Put "mail.domain.dom" into the outgoing box.<br>
Ok.<br>
...<br>

Hit next.<br>

Do you see where it says "account name"?<br>

Type your account name in there.<br>
Ok.<br>
Now, do you see where it says "password"?<br>
Yes.<br>
