Got up this morning at 2:50 am, left around 3:10, on I-70 around 4am (stopped for gas and to check the luggage rack).

It's now 10am and we're travelling through North Carolina.  I'm connected via cell, travelling about 75mph on I-95, sharing my connection with Robin via a wi-fi ad-hoc network.  I left it open, so if anyone is on I-95 around mile marker 127... hop on and keep up!
