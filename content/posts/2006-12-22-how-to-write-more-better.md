<li>One should never generalize.</li>
<li>Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once                               said: "I hate quotations. Tell me what you know."</li>
<li>Comparisons are as bad as cliches.</li>
<li>Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary;                                it's highly superfluous.</li>

<li>Do not use hyperbole; not one in a million can do                               it effectively.</li>
<li>Never use a big word when a diminutive alternative                              would suffice.</li>

<li>Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.</li>
