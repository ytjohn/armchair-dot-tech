Quick update.  Dryden is now hosting his pictures on here as well.  Check them <a href="http://www.sqbnet.net/pics/dryden">out</a>.
You probably need to get to page 15 or so (can't remember off hand, don't feel like looking it up) before you get to the Fallujah pics.  The rest are from Cali and before.
