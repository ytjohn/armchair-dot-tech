More pictures are up now.. basically I just grouped all of November's (except the ball) into one <a href="/pics/v/2005/november/">album</a>.  Umm.. not too much going on, I feel like I've put my life on pause as I try to finish up some projects I've committed myself to.  However, I am getting some good stuff accomplished that will help me out down the road, which is good.
