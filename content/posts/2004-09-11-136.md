Touched down in Kuwait last night (9/11, a very commemorative date) and on our way to Iraq tonight.  Things have improved a lot since last time.  Lots of niceties, I suppose to contrast the bad situation going on outside the firm bases.  Anyways, thanks for everyone's support and prayers.  If anyone would like to write:<br />

I'll post more as time permits.  Perhaps a nice log of my take on the war will be possible this time.  Cheers!
