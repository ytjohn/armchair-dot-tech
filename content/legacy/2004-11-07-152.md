We have begun.  It was pretty interesting yesterday when everyone was getting staged to go in.  Last night, we took out an 8-building apartment complex and secured a hospital.  Back here on base, all you can hear is the sound of artillery pounding away, all night and all day. There hasn't really been any incoming.  I think the insurgents are being kept pretty busy elsewhere.  The next 14 days will be pretty darn interesting.
