Back in 1995, Microsoft Word had a problem with auto-page numbering in
the footer of documents that affected the page numbers as well as the
font used if changed from the default 12pt Times Roman. 9 years later,
this exact same bug remains.

See, now, whereas some may call this a bug, isn't it far more
positive to characterize it as a commitment to tradition?
It's you humorless types that give /. such a negative reputation...
