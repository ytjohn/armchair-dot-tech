According an <a href="http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=209746">article</a>, Gen-X is setup worse than any other generation for a financial crash.  My favorite quote: "I had a college president say to me, 'I don't know how much longer I can pull this off because people will start to ask, Is it worth this much money to be that much smarter?'
