<blockquote>Garp was looking for Lumber when he discovered Marriage; he had some innocent questions to ask about two-by-fours when Marriage caught his eye and raised more interesting and disturbing questions.  Garp had never realized, for example, that there were more marriage counselors than lumberyards.  - The World According to Garp</blockquote>
