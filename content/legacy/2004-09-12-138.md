Well, we have another flight scheduled for late tonight... anyone taking bets on wether we make to Iraq this time or not?  In other news, I managed to get a shower and put on the same stinky clothes again.  I won't really get into my good clothes until we can really unpack.  I'll keep people posted as time permits. :}
