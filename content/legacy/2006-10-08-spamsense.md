I've been noticing computer generated poetry in spam for a while now, but this one really inspired me.  It almost seems like ancient proverbs that got a bit muddled in  the translation.  "It takes a real fruitcake to avoid contact with the scythe." and  this interesting one: "If a girlscout graduates from the pickup truck, then some  mysterious cargo bay gets stinking drunk." (We've come a long way from when I first noticed <a title="spam poetry" href="/wp/rants/195">spam poetry</a>.

>If the minivan about a pine cone usually competes with a mortician over the support group, then a skyscraper hides. Any sandwich can accurately sanitize an imaginative deficit, but it takes a real fruit cake to avoid contact with the scythe. The cab driver for an industrial complex ostensibly is a big fan of a grain of sand. A hockey player seeks a steam engine. Now and then, an asteroid near a paper napkin pees on the boiled warranty.
> 
> Now and then, a pork chop eagerly shares a shower with the tuba player living with a customer. A plaintiff completely seeks a polar bear. A movie theater shares a shower with a chestnut. An eggplant gives a pink slip to the tuba player. For example, a single-handledly impromptu bullfrog indicates that a class action suit beyond another burglar somewhat avoids contact with an ocean. When the lover is righteous, a spartan tripod brainwashes the pork chop related to another crank case. Sometimes a turkey trembles, but a cowboy over a hockey player always pours freezing cold water on a surly hole puncher! Some asteroid over a rattlesnake plans an escape from the false reactor some vacuum cleaner. A cheese wheel self-flagellates, and the defendant feels nagging remorse; however, the polar bear pees on the cyprus mulch behind a cowboy. The ball bearing, a bartender near a turn signal, and a ravishing eggplant are what made America great! A Eurasian inferiority complex A submarine is South American. Any vacuum cleaner can organize a rude cloud formation, but it takes a real tornado to bury the pompous polar bear. Now and then, an almost tattered movie theater pours freezing cold water on a satellite beyond some vacuum cleaner. Indeed, a briar patch takes a peek at the hairy squid.

> The tabloid beyond a reactor When a garbage can is ridiculously feline, another chess board over a wedding dress graduates from a highly paid carpet tack. Now and then, some mortician for the garbage can barely shares a shower with a false fire hydrant. When an orbiting buzzard trembles, a wheelbarrow hides. Sometimes the barely feline paycheck flies into a rage, but the elusive roller coaster always graduates from a power drill living with a lover! A graduated cylinder related to a stovepipe throws a thoroughly impromptu bullfrog at a steam engine, or an infected apartment building finds subtle faults with a crispy traffic light. The self-loathing industrial complex Furthermore, a recliner prays, and the lithe spirit related to some tabloid bestows great honor upon another senator toward a chess board. Another cloud formation over a minivan sanitizes the bullfrog. When you see the revered fighter pilot, it means that the cashier flies into a rage. The earring buries a moronic deficit. A roller coaster of a cowboy shares a shower with a mastadon.

> A stovepipe defined by a sandwich takes a peek at a South American ski lodge. Aself-actualized pickup truck sells the garbage can defined by a vacuum cleaner to a bartender. Some precise food stamp conquers the diskette. When an optimal girl scout is lazily pompous, the elusive traffic light competes with the ridiculously cosmopolitan buzzard. A satellite eagerly eats a cyprus mulch. Furthermore, the crank case flies into a rage, and the grand piano sanitizes a paternal bullfrog. When another annoying steam engine ruminates, a tornado of a scythe ceases to exist. The hole puncher related to an inferiority complex borrows money from a molten hole puncher, but a grizzly bear graduates from the cosmopolitan tabloid. A fruit cake around another chestnut meditates, and a pork chop panics; however, a line dancer from the crank case finds subtle faults with an ocean. If a girl scout graduates from the pickup truck, then some mysterious cargo bay gets stinking drunk.
