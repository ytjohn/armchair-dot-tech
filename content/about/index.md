Hi, I'm John Hogenmiller, the Armchair Technician and I like to write a lot of words about things I don't understand. I don't really know what I'm doing, so I write about them as if I did. There is a hope that in doing so, I come to understand it a bit better, and maybe someone reading one of these posts will see the struggles I went through and decide not to repeat them.

>_"It is the way I think. I am a very bottom-up thinker. If you give me the right kind of Tinker Toys, I can imagine the building. I can sit there and see primitives and recognize their power to build structures a half mile high, if only I had just one more to make it functionally complete. I can see those kinds of things."_  - Ken Thompson

>_"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."_  - Robert Heinlein

>_"When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."_ - Futurama
